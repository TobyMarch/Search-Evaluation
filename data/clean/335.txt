review
despite
its
lascivious
reputation
the
pleasures
of
lolita
are
as
much
intellectual
as
erogenous
it
is
a
love
story
with
the
power
to
raise
both
chuckles
and
eyebrows
humbert
humbert
is
a
european
intellectual
adrift
in
america
haunted
by
memories
of
a
lost
adolescent
love
when
he
meets
his
ideal
nymphet
in
the
shape
of
12yearold
dolores
haze
he
constructs
an
elaborate
plot
to
seduce
her
but
first
he
must
get
rid
of
her
mother
in
spite
of
his
diabolical
wit
reality
proves
to
be
more
slippery
than
humbert's
feverish
fantasies
and
lolita
refuses
to
conform
to
his
image
of
the
perfect
lover
playfully
perverse
in
form
as
well
as
content
riddled
with
puns
and
literary
allusions
nabokov's
1955
novel
is
a
hymn
to
the
russianborn
author's
delight
in
his
adopted
language
indeed
readers
who
want
to
probe
all
of
its
allusive
nooks
and
crannies
will
need
to
consult
the
annotated
edition
lolita
is
undoubtedly
brazenly
erotic
but
the
eroticism
springs
less
from
the
frail
honeyhued
shoulders

the
silky
supple
bare
back
of
little
lo
than
it
does
from
the
wantonly
gorgeous
prose
that
humbert
uses
to
recount
his
forbidden
passion
she
was
musical
and
applesweet

lola
the
bobbysoxer
devouring
her
immemorial
fruit
singing
through
its
juice

and
every
movement
she
made
every
shuffle
and
ripple
helped
me
to
conceal
and
to
improve
the
secret
system
of
tactile
correspondence
between
beast
and
beautybetween
my
gagged
bursting
beast
and
the
beauty
of
her
dimpled
body
in
its
innocent
cotton
frock
much
has
been
made
of
lolita
as
metaphor
perhaps
because
the
love
affair
at
its
heart
is
so
troubling
humbert
represents
the
formal
educated
old
world
of
europe
while
lolita
is
america
ripening
beautiful
but
not
too
bright
and
a
little
vulgar
nabokov
delights
in
exploring
the
intercourse
between
these
cultures
and
the
passages
where
humbert
describes
the
suburbs
and
strip
malls
and
motels
of
postwar
america
are
filled
with
both
attraction
and
repulsion
those
restaurants
where
the
holy
spirit
of
huncan
dines
had
descended
upon
the
cute
paper
napkins
and
cottagecheesecrested
salads
yet
however
tempting
the
novel's
symbolism
may
be
its
chief
delightand
powerlies
in
the
character
of
humbert
humbert
he
at
least
as
he
tells
it
is
no
seedy
skulker
no
twisted
destroyer
of
innocence
instead
nabokov's
celebrated
mouthpiece
is
erudite
and
witty
even
at
his
most
depraved
humbert
can't
help
itlinguistic
jouissance
is
as
important
to
him
as
the
satisfaction
of
his
arrested
libido

i
have
no
real
excuse
for
not
reading
lolita
before
this
late
date
it's
certainly
a
book
that
crops
up
in
conversation
a
great
deal
i
watched
the
james
mason
film
version
of
the
book
years
agoperhaps
that's
what
put
me
off
i
recently
watched
the
jeremy
irons
version
and
loved
it
i
suppose
part
of
me
asked
why
myself
why
i'd
want
to
read
a
book
that
is
essentially
the
ramblings
of
a
middleaged
pervert
anyway
i
decided
that
i'd
procrastinated
long
enough
and
it
was
time
to
get
serious
and
find
out
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
the
story
is
narrated
by
middleaged
humbert
humbert
he's
a
pedophilealthough
he's
tried
denying
it
tried
disguising
it
and
tried
channeling
his
baser
instincts
but
as
luck
would
have
it
humbert
finds
himself
as
the
lodger
at
the
home
of
a
buxom
lonely
widow
charlotte
haze
and
12yearold
daughter
lolita
humbert
doesn't
particularly
even
like
lolitahe
actually
finds
her
rather
dull
but
she
becomes
a
vessel
for
the
fantasies
left
by
humbert's
unfulfilled
first
love
affair
due
to
the
subject
matter
the
book
was
at
times
rather
difficult
to
read
and
it
is
a
tribute
to
nabokov's
skill
as
a
writer
that
i
was
gripped
by
this
story
humbert
humbert
is
at
his
most
'human'
(introspective)
during
his
pre
and
postlolita
phases
once
humbert
crosses
the
boundaries
of
ethical
behaviour
and
begins
a
physical
relationship
with
lolita
there
is
no
going
back
at
times
humbert
congratulates
himself
for
his
cleverness
and
calls
himself
a
magician
and
then
at
other
times
humbert
seems
to
realize
how
despicable
he
truly
is
unfortunately
the
occasional
flash
of
insight
is
too
pale
and
fleeting
to
release
humbert
from
his
obsession
with
his
nymphet
and
so
humbert
accepts
his
enslavement
and
ultimate
fate
as
the
novel
develops
humbert
relates
his
seduction
of
lolita
and
his
subsequent
relationship
towards
the
child
his
manipulative
behaviour
with
lolita
was
nauseating
and
he
acknowledges
that
lolita
has
absolutely
nowhere
else

humbert
is
a

at

his

chilling

while
i
despised
the

the
story
was
compelling
how
did
nabokov
manage
this?
the
brilliant

of
the

is
a
triumph

the

if
you've
only
heard
of
lolita
from
its
reputation
as
being
pornographic
you
are
in
for
a
surprise
when
you
read
it
yes
it
involves
a
lecherous
middle
aged
man
chasing
after
a
12
year
old
nymphet
yes
it
is
deeply
disturbing
and
makes
one
queasy
at
times
it
is
also
a
brilliant
funny
witty
literary
rollercoaster
which
will
delight
you
and
dazzle
you
with
the
beauty
of
language
nabakov
can
make
words
jump
through
hoops
you
never
even
knew
existed
while
he
explores
the
dark
realms
of
obsession
and
longing
the
narrator
humbert
humbert
is
a
fascinating
construction
as
readers
we
find
ourselves
simultaneously
repelled
by
his
actions
and
sympathetic
to
his
yearning
we
are
utterly
charmed
by
his
wit
intelligence
and
verbal
acrobatics
sometimes
to
the
point
where
we
lost
sight
of
what
he's
doing
to
his
object
of
desire
lolita
i
would
suggest
that
all
readers
reaquaint
themselves
with
the
concept
of
the
unreliable
narrator
before
they
sink
into
humbert's
hypnotic
web
of
logic
when
you
find
yourself
sympathizing
with
hum
about
lolita's
cruelties
try
to
remember
that
you
are
seeing
everything
through
his
twisted
and
selfserving
lens
humbert
has
rationalized
his
behavior
so
deeply
and
reports
it
to
us
so
entertainingly
that
we
find
ourselves
accepting
his
interpretations
of
people
and
events
at
face
value
however
we
must
remember
that
hum
is
capable
of
the
most
monsterous
of
deceptions
(note
how
long
it
takes
him
to
inform
lolita
of
her
mother's
demise)
and
of
self
deceptions
read
between
the
lines
question
his
reading
of
events
pay
attention
when
his
reporting
is
at
odds
with
his
interpretations
of
them
as
one
example
humbert
tells
us
that
he
was
seduced
by
lolita
giving
us
the
impression
that
she
was
sexually
mature
and
a
willing
partner
contrast
that
with
his
throwaway
mentioning
of
her
performing
for
him
in
exchange
for
treats
and
watching
television
as
he
took
his
pleasure
in
her
and
don't
ignore
lolita
sobbing
each
night
as
he
seems
to
do
nabokov
has
created
a
connundrum
for
us
as
readers
he
uses
the
most
glorious
tricks
and
delights
of
the
english
language
to
tell
his
tale
of
selfdeception
and
rationalization
masquerading
as
love
look
beyond
the
circus
to
the
grime
beneath
it
and
appreciate
the
mastery
that
gives
us

this
is
a
magnificent
book
in
many
ways
most
of
which
have
been
commented
onoften
brilliantlyby
amazon
reviewers
i
would
therefore
like
to
restrict
my
comments
to
the
morality
of
the
book
and
to
those
who
to
this
day
view
the
book
with
outrage
even
those
who
admire
the
book
somehow
feel
compelled
to
comment
that
they
are
disturbed
by
it
why
is
this?
let
us
first
examine
the
novel
itself
as
everybody
knows
it
is
the
story
of
humbert
humbert
a
fullgrown
adult
malenot
an
old
manwho
seduces
a
compliant
twelveyear
old
girl
and
then
goes
on
to
have
a
year
or
so
long
affair
with
her
i
put
the
term
affair
in
quotation
marks
because
it
probably
isn't
appropriate
to
describe
a
sexual
relationship
between
a
full
grown
male
and
a
female
child
in
such
terms
is
it
safe
to
say
that
most
rational
human
beings
disapprove
of
such
relationships?
it
is
certainly
safe
to
say
that
nabakovand
his
narratorknow
that
such
relationships
are
wrong
this
is
important
the
tale
is
not
only
told
in
the
context
of
a
moral
universe
it
is
also
told
by
a
character
who
is
in
acceptance
of
a
moral
universe
oh
he
makes
a
comment
here
and
there
about
some
medieval
king
marrying
his
twelve
year
old
cousin
but
clearly
his
heart
isn't
in
it
he
knows
that
he
is
a
monster
a
brute
indeed
his
goal
was
never
to
have
sex
with
a
conscious
lolita
to
begin
with
his
goal
initially
was
only
to
fondle
her
after
drugging
her
to
induce
sleep
she
was
never
to
know
what
he
was
doing
of
course
this
is
also
reprehensible
but
clearly
it
shows
a
conscience
at
work
a
conscience
motivated
in
part
by
fear
to
be
sure
but
also
a
conscience
for
the
welfareat
least
early
onof
this
little
girl
conscience
is
not
normally
a
factor
in
purely
prurient
forms
of
entertainment
following
this
encounter
he
takes
lolita
on
a
journey
across
around
and
through
the
united
states
living
in
hotel
rooms
and
buying
clothes
and
food
on
the
move
toward
the
end
of
this
we
find
one
of
the
most
moving
paragraphs
in
literature
and
so
we
rolled
east



we
had
been
everywhere
we
had
really
seen
nothing
and
i
catch
myself
thinking
today
that
our
long
journey
had
only
defiled
with
a
sinuous
trail
of
slime
the
lovely
trustful
dreamy
enormous
country
that
by
then
in
retrospect
was
no
more
to
us
than
a
collection
of
dogeared
maps
ruined
tourbooks
old
tires
and
her
sobs
in
the
nightevery
night
every
nightthe
moment
i
feigned
sleep
the
narrator's
revelation
of
such
anguish
on
the
part
of
his
victim
clearly
works
against
the
argument
that
this
novel
was
merely
intended
to
be
pornographic
humbert
makes
it
clear
that
he
loves
his
lolita
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
this
he
loves
the
way
she
moves
he
loves
the
down
on
her
arm
he
loves
her
grace
on
the
tennis
court
he
loves
the
way
she
flicks
her
head
at
him
when
looking
up
from
a
book
he
loves
her
toes
her
shoes
her
name
he
describes
her
in
beautiful
poignant
poetic
language
memorable
and
moving
in
every
respect
indeed
the
english
language
has
rarely
been
used
so
wonderfully
but
nowhere
in
this
book
does
he
describe
in
such
terms
or
any
other
terms
her
sexual
characteristics
or
comment
at
length
or
in
glaring
detail
his
physical
relations
with
her
finally
there
is
no
effort
to
sugarcoat
the
effect
of
all
of
this
on
lolita
herself
we
learn
that
after
she
left
humbert
she
entered
into
a
series
of
tawdry
sexual
escapadesstill
at
too
young
an
agewith
a
debased
playwright
we
last
see
her
in
her
late
teens
married
to
a
bumpkin
and
living
in
a
clapboard
shack
surrounded
by
weeds
obviously
to
anybody
who
has
bothered
to
read
this
book
the
presentation
of
the
subject
matter
is
not
what
is
objectionable
therefore
what
apparently
disturbs
most
people
is
the
subject
matter
itself
but
why?
why
doesn't
the
latest
grisly
serialkillerofthemonth
novel
inspire
such
protest?
(has
there
ever
been
a
time
in
the
history
of
the
world
in
which
so
many
novels
have
been
written
about
serial
killers?)
why
not
the
barelydisguised
softporn
trash
by
danielle
steele
or
jackie
collins?
or
the
latest
anne
rice
gore
fest?
while
lolita
is
not
really
a
morality
tale
it
certainly
doesn't
glorify
its
subject
matter
the
way
novels
such
as
these
do
so
what
is
it?
i
think
that
with
lolita
nabakov
has
perhaps
unconsciously
touched
a
nerve
we
as
humans
are
rational
creatures
we
know
what
is
right
and
we
have
set
rules
for
ourselves
to
follow
everybody
agrees
that
murder
is
wrong
but
sexual
mores
have
changed
and
continue
to
change
in
our
affluent
western
societies
abortion
has
become
legal
which
gives
women
more
sexual
freedom
homosexuality
has
become
acceptable
which
allows
men
more
sexual
freedom
prostitution
and
pornography
are
rampant
without
discussing
the
morality
of
any
of
this
our
society
is
now
in
rapidly
changing
and
uncharted
territory
perhaps
the
objection
to
lolita
is
from
those
who
look
at
the
book
and
wonder
how
far
we
are
going
to
go
