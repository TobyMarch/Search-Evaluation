this
was
my
favorite
film
in
the
series
i
think
bane
was
a
much
better
villain
and
tom
hardy
was
amazing
it's
a
shame
that
people
give
ledger
such
applause
knowing
that
he
died
afterward
it
was
oscar
worthy﻿
but
the
saga
continues
without
him
if
jimi
hendrix
was
still
alive
he
might
not
be
considered
the
greatest
guitarist
ever

honestly
i
would
of
love
to
see
batman
break
his
one
rule
and
kill
bane
but
i
know
that
would
never
happen
so
my
second
way
of
him
dying
is
him
trying
to
stop
batman
from
defusing
the
nuclear
bomb
but
he
dies
in
the
explosion
and
batman
lives
and
go
to
france
with
selinathat
would
have
a
lot
of
action
and
a
great
way
of
bane
dying
what
do
you
think?﻿

i
agree
with
everyone
between
500
–
526
both
tim
burton

christopher
nolan
have
set
the
bar
extremely
high
with
their
groundbreaking

unique
batman
films
they
have
both
revolutionized
the
look
tone

overall
experience
of
comic
book
films
forever
whoever
in
the
future
attempts
to
make
another
batman
really﻿
has
their
work
cut
out
for
them
but
then
again
you
never
know
both
burton

nolan
were
relatively
unknown
directors
prior
to
their
batman
films

the
film's
poor
marking?
people
worldwide
have
been
clawing
and
fighting
to
see
images

commentary
related
to
the
dark
knight
rises
for
about
4
years
this
film
didn't
need
advertising
and
marketing
there
was
so﻿
much
hype
and
build
up
to
it
and
that
excessive
marketing
for
warner
bros
was
unnecessary
and
i'm
glad
that
this
film
wasn't
exploited
like
many
other
films
that
practically
show
you
the
entire
movie
just
in
their
film
trailer

while
the
dark
knight﻿
rises
was
a
really
good

awesome
movie
it
felt
rushed
which
is
one
of
the
major
problems
with
it
the
2
previous
batman
movies
had
great
pacing
for
the
story
to
unfold
naturally
were
as
the
tdkr
had
a
lot
of
moments
that
were
really
forced

required
you
to
really
suspend
your
disbelief
but
all
that
aside
this
was
still
a
really
good
movie
not
one
of
nolan’s
stronger
films
but
still
great
i’m
saying
this
as
any
respectful
batman

nolan
fan
please
support
tdkr!

they
hardly
showed
anything
its
like
talia
telling
this
great
story
and
then
out
of
knowhere
catwoman
shows
up
and
blows
up
bane﻿
then
they
totally
forget
about
that
and
leave
that
was
my
biggest
complaint
about
this
movie
but
other
than
that
is
was
extrodinary
