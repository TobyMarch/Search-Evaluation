antoine
de
saintexup&eacutery
first
published
the
little
prince
in
1943
only
a
year
before
his
lockheed
p38
vanished
over
the
mediterranean
during
a
reconnaissance
mission
more
than
a
half
century
later
this
fable
of
love
and
loneliness
has
lost
none
of
its
power
the
narrator
is
a
downed
pilot
in
the
sahara
desert
frantically
trying
to
repair
his
wrecked
plane
his
efforts
are
interrupted
one
day
by
the
apparition
of
a
little
well
prince
who
asks
him
to
draw
a
sheep
in
the
face
of
an
overpowering
mystery
you
don't
dare
disobey
the
narrator
recalls
absurd
as
it
seemed
a
thousand
miles
from
all
inhabited
regions
and
in
danger
of
death
i
took
a
scrap
of
paper
and
a
pen
out
of
my
pocket
and
so
begins
their
dialogue
which
stretches
the
narrator's
imagination
in
all
sorts
of
surprising
childlike
directions
the
little
prince
describes
his
journey
from
planet
to
planet
each
tiny
world
populated
by
a
single
adult
it's
a
wonderfully
inventive
sequence
which
evokes
not
only
the
great
fairy
tales
but
also
such
monuments
of
postmodern
whimsy
as
italo
calvino's
invisible
cities
and
despite
his
tone
of
gentle
bemusement
saintexup&eacutery
pulls
off
some
fine
satiric
touches
too
there's
the
king
for
example
who
commands
the
little
prince
to
function
as
a
oneman
(or
oneboy)
judiciary
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
there
is
an
old
rat
living
somewhere
on
my
planet
i
hear
him
at
night
you
could
judge
that
old
rat
from
time
to
time
you
will
condemn
him
to
death
that
way
his
life
will
depend
on
your
justice
but
you'll
pardon
him
each
time
for
economy's
sake
there's
only
one
rat
the
author
pokes
similar
fun
at
a
businessman
a
geographer
and
a
lamplighter
all
of
whom
signify
some
futile
aspect
of
adult
existence
yet
his
tale
is
ultimately
a
tender
onea
heartfelt
exposition
of
sadness
and
solitude
which
never
turns
into
peter
panstyle
treacle
such
delicacy
of
tone
can
present
real
headaches
for
a
translator
and
in
her
1943
translation
katherine
woods
sometimes
wandered
off
the
mark
giving
the
text
a
slightly
wooden
or
didactic
accent
happily
richard
howard
(who
did
a
fine
nipandtuck
job
on
stendhal's
the
charterhouse
of
parma
in
1999)
has
streamlined
and
simplified
to
wonderful
effect
the
result
is
a
new
and
improved
version
of
an
indestructible
classic
which
also
restores
the
original
artwork
to
full
color
trying
to
be
witty
we're
told
at
one
point
leads
to
lying
more
or
less
but
saintexup&eacutery's
drawings
offer
a
handy
rebuttal
they're
fresh
funny
and
like
the
book
itself
rigorously
truthful

katherine
woods'
simple
and
beautiful
translation
is
the
only
one
that
does
justice
to
the
little
prince
published
by
harcourt
in
1943
and
1971
her
translation
is
the
essential

the
translation
loved
and
quoted
by
englishspeaking
people
around
the
world
even
by
members
of
english
and
frenchspeaking
canadian
parliament!
but
hers
is
out
of
print
so
snatch
up
used
copies
while
you
may!
warning
there
is
a
new
translation
out
by
richard
howard
and
i
accidentally
got
one
ouch!
his
new
translation
purges
meaning
and
is
not
worth
the
money
it
gives
a
falseness
to
one
of
the
most
sincere
stories
ever
written
howard's
lacks
beauty
and
is
at
times
unintelligible
it
simply
does
not
make
sense
since
howard
has
no
apparent
understanding
of
the
truths
expressed
in
the
little
prince
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
one
important
example
says
it
all
the
fox's
secret
told
to
the
little
prince
in
parting

wood's
translation
reads
it
is
only
with
the
heart
that
one
can
see
rightly
what
is
essential
is
invisible
to
the
eye
she
uses
the
beautiful
rhetorical
mode
what
is
essential
compare
if
you
know
french
antoine
de
saint
exup&eacutery's
original
french
text
on
ne
voit
bien
qu'avec
le
cur
l'essentiel
est
invsible
pour
les
yeux
l'essentiel
is
in
the
same
mode
as
is
les
mis&eacuterables

neither
translate
exactly
into
english
les
mis&eacuterables
may
be
translated
as
the
miserable
ones
with
less
poetic
effect
likewise
l'essentiel
might
be
rendered
literally
the
essential
things
or
put
in
the
rhetorical
form
what
is
essential
if
richard
howard
wanted
to
make
the
statement
clearer
it
would
have
to
read
that
which
is
essential
is
invisible
to
the
eye

wordy
and
prosy
but
it
keeps
the
meaning
but
howard
doesn't
do
that
his
new
translation
of
the
same
line
read
one
sees
clearly
only
with
the
heart
anything
essential
is
invisible
to
the
eyes
huh?
anything
essential
is
invisible
to
the
eyes?
far
from
expressing
antoine
de
saint
exup&eacutery's
meaning
this
generalization
means
in
effect
nothing
and
it
is
obviously
not
true
water
is
essential
and
you
can
see
it
katherine
woods'
exquisite
translation
captures
the
essence
of
this
line
for
the
english
reader
it
is
only
with
the
heart
that
one
can
see
rightly
what
is
essential
is
invisible
to
the
eye
quintessential
no
line
in
the
book
is
more
important
it
epitomizes
her
entire
translation
it
is
ironic
that
in
translating
the
little
prince
howard
should
lose
that
which
is
essential
and
that
he
should
be
unable
to
see
with
his
heart
you
can
tell
the
difference
between
the
two
by
the
covers
woods'
shows
the
little
prince
on
a
white
background
howard's
is
on
midnight
blue
but
check
the
isbns!
amazoncom's
editorial

on
howard's
translation
says
that
katherine

sometimes

mark
giving
the

a
slightly

or
didactic
accent
happily
richard

this
would

katherine

to
wonderful
effect
capturing
the
essence
and
meaning
of
antoine
de

classic
in
a
timeless
translation
unhappily
and
unfortunately
richard
howardhas
streamlined

simplified
in
a
wordsonly
translation
and
he
wanders
off
the
mark
obscuring
what
were
otherwise
truths
both
simple
and
profound
giving
the
text
a
slightly
wooden
effect

as
for
howard's
translation
new
is
not
better
it's
just
new
woods'
translation
is
the
one
i
read
and
helped
me
to
understand
why
i
grieved
so
when
my
great
grandmother
died
we'd
spent
so
much
time
with
her
and
as
the
fox
says
to
the
little
prince
in
explaining
why
his
rose
is
so
important
to
him
it
is
the
time
you
have
wasted
for
your
rose
that
makes
your
rose
so
important
it
also
helps
me
keep
in
mind
what
i'm
doing
with
my
time
and
why
if
i
watch
tv
the
most
then
tv
becomes
the
most
important
if
i
pass
time
with
my
family
they
become
the
most
important
another
alwaystoberemembered
example
of
a
passage
from
woods'
translation
dealing
with
the
interaction
of
the
little
prince
and
the
fox
when
the
little
prince
has
to
say
goodbye
to
the
fox
the
fox
says
ah
i
shall
cry
it's
your
own
fault
said
the
little
prince
i
never
wished
you
any
sort
of
harm
but
you
wanted
me
to
tame
you
yes
that
is
so
said
the
fox
but
now
you
are
going
to
cry!
said
the
little
prince
yes
that
is
so
said
the
fox
then
it
has
done
you
no
good
at
all!
it
has
done
me
good
said
the
fox
because
of
the
color
of
the
wheat
fields
before
the
little
prince
tamed
the
fox
the
wheat
field
had
nothing
to
say
to
the
fox
but
he
had
said
to
the
little
prince
you
have
hair
that
is
the
color
of
gold
think
how
wonderful
that
will
be
when
you
have
tamed
me!
the
grain
which
is
also
golden
will
bring
me
back
the
thought
of
you
and
i
shall
love
to
listen
to
the
wind
in
the
wheat
i
used
to
dislike
giant
sunflowers
then
i
discovered
that
someone
i
love
like
them
very
much
so
we
planted
some
and
cared
for
them
together
now
when
i
see
giant
sunflowers
i
remember
him
and
my
heart
is
happy
i
understand
because
i
read
and
reread
wood's
translation
of
the
little
prince
since
i
was
a
child
it
is
as
beautiful
today
as
it
was
40
years
ago

this
is
just
a
note
to
say
beware
of
the
new
translation
if
you've
previously
read
and
enjoyed
the
katherine
woods
version
mr
howard
makes
the
argument
in
his
translator's
note
that
the
language
has
changed
since
the
1940's
and
that
a
new
translation
is
needed
i
couldn't
disagree
more
and
i
[do]
speak
with
some
experience
on
this
subject
i
read
this
title
at
school
in
the
original
french
language
for
three
different
classes
as
well
as
numerous
times
in
english
(the
woods
version)
katherine
woods
beautifully
captured
the
feel
of
the
french
original
the
new
howard
translation
is
in
a
more
modern
english
which
mostly
succeeds
at
removing
the
poetry
that
previously
existed
and
little
else
that
i
can
find
it
does
not
make
the
story
any
more
clear
or
nuanced
than
it
previously
was
rather
less
so
i
find
the
arguments
for
a
new
translation
indefencible
three
stars
is
not
a
review
of
the
book
but
of
the
translation
this
title
is
beyond
excellent
but
you
might
do
yourself
a
favor
and
find
a
used
copy
with
the
woods
translation
(there
are
many
copies
out
there)
enjoy!

november

opening
the
cover
of
any
new
book
comes
with
a
feeling
of
great
anticipation
however
the
thought
of
seeing
how
exupery's
art
would
be
made
into
popup
cutouts
accelerated
that
feeling
into
one
of
almost
surreal
joy
fortunately
i
wasn't
disappointed
the
illustrations
are
beautifully
rendered
and
the
quality
of
the
materials
are
to
be
appreciated
i
especially
am
grateful
that
the
story
is
completely
unabridged
leaving
the
words
and
the
feelings
to
carry
on
to
work
their
magic
for
years
to
come
i've
purchased
an
additional
five
copies
to
give
as
collectible
gifts
to
others
whom
i
know
love
this
tale
of
life
love
and
death
it
is
certainly
a
musthave
edition
for
any
collector
of
popup
books
classic
children's
tales
or
philosophical
classics
i
cannot
recommend
it
highly
enough

book
but
came
with
a
small
flaw
the
popup
version
is
very
well
made
all
the
bits
appear
sturdy
and
they
have
really
put

making
each
