her

before

these

the
music
album
before
the

madonna
recorded
a
statement
to
her
fans
hey
mr
dj
put
a
record
on
hi
it's
madonna
you've
probably
been
hearing
about
my
new
record
'music'
for
a
while
well
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
you
knew
that
the
single
is
gonna
drop
very
soon
i
worked
on
it
with
a
french
guy
named
mirwais
and
he
is
the
shit
the
album
will
be
released
worldwide
on
september
19
and
i
hope
you
like
my
music[3]
madonna
ended
her
relationship
with
carlos
leon
in
december
1998
saying
that
they
were
better
off
as
best
friends[4]
then
she
said
that
left
me
incredibly
cynical
about
love
for
a
long
time
and
then
also
my
fame
increased
and
i
had
a
lovehate
relationship
with
that
feeling
trapped
by
it
and
feeling
angry
about
it
i
was
running
the
gamut
of
emotions
and
i
think
that
creatively
i
was
all
over
the
place[5]
madonna
became
involved
in
a
relationship
with
guy
ritchie
whom
she
had
met
in
1999
through
mutual
friends
sting
and
his
wife
trudie
styler
she
become
pregnant
and
they
had
a
son
rocco
ritchie
on
august
11
2000
just
one
month
before
the
album's
release[3]
she
filmed

was

pregnant[6]

mirwais
ahmadza&iuml
was
introduced
by
madonna's
partner
guy
oseary
in
an
interview
with
cnn
she
said
guy
oseary
my
partner
at
maverick
[records]
was
given
a
demo
by
a
french
artist
called
mirwais
she
said
[he]
slipped
it
to
me
and
said
'what
do
you
think
[of
him]
as
an
artist
to
sign
at
maverick?'
[]
i
just
said
'oh
my
god
this
is
what
i
want'
i
just
flipped
over
it
and
said
'please
find
out
if
he
wants
to
work
with
me'[8]
madonna
said
that
the
producer
is
a
genius[9]
she
also
commented
about
working
with
ahmadza&iuml
and
the
other
producers
of
the
album
i
love
to
work
with
the
weirdos
that
no
one
knows
about—the
people
who
have
raw
talent
and
who
are
making
music
unlike
anyone
else
out
there
music
is
the
future
of
sound[10]
in
an
interview
with
mtv's
total
request
live
she
said
ahmadza&iuml
was
really
influenced
by
1970s
funk
and
rb
and
said
that
the
album
was
more
electronic
than
her
last
record
but
it
is
edgier
and
a
bit
funkier[11]
talking
about
the
inspiration
behind
music
madonna
said
the
album
was
to
join
the
coldness
or
the
remoteness
of
living
in
the
machine
age
in
the
world
of
high
technology
with
warmth
and
compassion
and
a
sense
of
humor
[]
music
is
supposed
to
be
a
reflection
of
what's
going
on
in
society
and
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
we've
become
too
complacent[12]
the
album
was
madonna's
first
album
not
to
have
been
totally
recorded
in
the
united
states
instead
it
was
mostly
recorded
at
sarm
west
and
east
studios
in
london
england[7]
madonna
started
recording
the
album
in
september
1999
and
ended
in
january
2000[10]
mirwais
ahmadza&iuml
spoke
little
english
and
madonna
commented
the
first
couple
of
days
we
were
recording
i
wanted
to
rip
my
hair
out
[]
it
didn't
seem
like
there
was
any
way
for
us
to
communicate
his
manager
had
to
come
in
and
translate
everything
at
first[9]
in
an
interview
with
the
face
madonna
was
questioned
about
her
mood
while
developing
the
album
she
commented
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
didn't
know
what
the
mood
was
i
feel
like
an
animal
that's
like
ready
to
be
sprung
from
a
cage
i've
been
living
a
pretty
lowkey
domestic
existence
and
i
miss
things
like
i
miss
performing
and
dancing
and
being
on
the
road
that
kind
of
energy
so
part
of
the
record
is
about
that
and
then
the
other
part
is
about
love
so
there's
the
frivolous
side
of
my
life
and
then
there's
the
–hopefully–
nonfrivolous
side
of
my
life
i
usually
make
a
record
that's
one
or
the
other
and
i
feel
i
did
both
on
this
one[5]
music
structure
and
lyrics
the
first
time
we
cut
vocals
my
headphones
had
a
little
reverb
but
there
was
none
on
the
board
when
they
recorded
me
at
first
i
was
mildly
freaked
out
it
sounded
so
raw
but
then
i
got
into
the
intimacy
of
how
the
vocal
was
presented
in
fact
i
got
into
it
to
the
point
where
i
insisted
that
there
be
no
effects
on
my
vocals
anywhere
on
the
album
regardless
of
the
producer
madonna
about
the
vocoder's
vocal
distortion
on
the
song
nobody's
perfect[9]
slant
magazine's
sal
cinquemani
described
the
album
as
having
a
more
experimental
direction[13]
with
the
face
magazine
madonna
explained
her
inspirations
behind
the
songs
and
the
music
of
music
she
said
this
record
more
than
any
other
records
covers
all
the
areas
of
my
life
i
left
off
partying
on
ray
of
light
but
i'd
just
had
a
baby
so
my
mood
was
complete
like
wonderment
of
life
and
i
was
incredibly
thoughtful
and
retrospective
and
intrigued
by
the
mystical
aspects
of
life[5]
music
the
title
track
is
the
first
featured
on
the
record
starting
with
madonna's
androgynous
voice
saying
hey
mr
dj
put
a
record
on
i
want
to
dance
with
my
baby
above
this
lyric
madonna's
voice
electronically
manipulated
asks
do
you
like
to
boogie
woogie?
the
lyric
i
wanna
dance
with
my
baby
may
further
reinforce
a
connection
with
gay
listenters[14]
according
to
santiago
fouzhern&aacutendez
in
his
book
madonna's
drowned
worlds
new
approaches
to
her
cultural
transformations
music
is
a
'disco
anthem
and
the
beat
commands
[the
people]
to
get
up
and
dance'[14]
he
also
said
that
the
song
is
an
expression
to
her
public
the
and
it
is
one
of
madonna's
cathiest
singles
of
her
career[14]
the
second
track
impressive
instant
is
a
clubsavvy
stomper
marked
by
futuristic
keyboard
lines
and
vocals
that
dark
from
distorted
and
robotic
passages
madonna
claimed
that
the
song
was
the
most
hardest
to
write[12][9]
madonna
sings
i
like
to
singy
singy
singy
like
a
bird
on
a
wingy
wingy
wingy
with
childlike
abandon
amid
a
vibrant
celebratory
swirl
of
electronic
keyboard
riffs
and
thumpy
dance
beats[9]
the
third
track
runaway
lover
is
a
trance/house
rave
track
it
is
one
of
madonna's
collaboration
for
the
album[9]
the
following
track
i
deserve
it
is
an
acousticframed
track
that
is
anchored
by
a
hiphop
inflected
groove
madonna
said
the
track
has
the
strangest
juxtaposition
of
this
folky
simple
song
and
this
highteeh
ominous
synth
line
the
song
lends
weight
to
rich
introspective
lyrics
such
as
the
chorus
lines
many
miles
many
roads
i
have
traveled
fallen
down
of
the
way/many
hearts
many
years
have
unraveled
leading
up
to
today[9]
amazing
the
fifth
track
is
a
vibrant
temposhifter
that
opens
with
a
soft
musicboxlike
keyboard/string
flourish[9]
the
song
has
been
compared
by
madonna
with
beautiful
stranger
(1999)
saying
that
the
reason
because
she
fighted
with
her
record
company
to
cancel
the
release
as
a
single
was
because
its
similarity
the
sixth
track
nobody's
perfect
shows
ethreal
vocal
and
dreamy
keyboard[9]
the
following
track
and
second
single
don't
tell
me
was
written
by
joe
henry
madonna's
brotherinlaw[9]
he
performed
and
released
the
track
originally
named
stop
on
his
2001
album
scar[9]
his
wife
melanie
sent
a
demo
of
the
track
to
her
sister
who
liked
it
and
recorded
her
version
it
is
framed
by
soft
acoustic
guitars
and
subtle
keyboard
lines[9]
the
eighth
track
and
third
single
what
it
feels
like
for
a
girl
comments
on
female
roleplaying
in
society
the
following
track
paradise
(not
for
me)
has
lyrics
sang
in
french
and
the
lyric
i
can't
remember
when
i
was
young
i
can't
express
if
it
was
wrong
reflected
an
artistic
palette
encompassing
diverse
musical
textual
and
visual
styles
in
its
lyrics[15]
musically
it
draws
influence
from
edith
piaf[9]
the
song
was
also
in
mirwais
ahmadza&iuml
album
production[5]
the
tenth
and
final
track
on
the
album
gone
contrasts
acoustic
guitars
with
electronic
elements
soulful
vocals
give
depth
to
such
striking
eautionary
lyrics
as
turn
to
stone
lose
my
faith
and
i'll
be
gone[9]

had
worked
with
her
on

light
calling
them
repetitive
and
uninteresting
despite
being
catchy[13]
dimitri
ehrlich
from

described
the
album
as
a
masterpiece
of
brilliantly
arranged
keyboards
futuristic
drums
and
electronica
dressings
with
folky
acoustic
guitars
and
a
vaguely
spiritual
bent
to
her
lyrics
(like
those
on

it's
a
weird
and
freshsounding
album[22]
andrew

claimed

brilliant
futuristic

gave
the

a
a

writing
that
her
most
patchwork
record
since
the
sean
penn
years
in
the
way
it
tiptoes
around
sundry
moods
and
beats
music
is
frustratingly
inconsistent
as
if
madonna
herself
weren't
sure
where
to
venture
next

it
feels
like
a
collection
of

clever
intriguing
ones
to

that

to
compensate
for
ordinary

and
madonna's
stoic
