critics
lisa
schwarzbaum
and
owen
gleiberman
discuss
a
little
film
you
may
have
heard
about
called&nbspthe
dark
knight
rises
schwarzbaum
was
disappointed
by
christopher
nolan’s
trilogyender
“it’s
so
big
and
so
broad
and
held
on
the
shoulders
of
a
villain
who
bottom
line
is
boring”
she
says
but
gleiberman
enjoyed
it
“i
think
the
movie
earned
it’s
bigness”
he
explains
“even
though
it
doesn’t
have
the
total
surprise
that
the
dark
knight
had
it’s
full
of
surprises
i
think
the
the
feeling
it
gives
you
is
of
being
not
just
a
movie
but
an
experience
that’s
its
impact”
