(1968–1974)
in
1968
guitarist
brian
may
a
student
at
london's
imperial
college
and
bassist
tim
staffell
decided
to
form
a
band
may

a

dental
student
auditioned
and
got
the
job
the
group
called
themselves
smile[3]
while
attending
ealing
art
college
tim
staffell
became
friends
with
farrokh
bulsara
a
fellow
student
who
had
assumed
the
english
name
of
freddie
bulsara
felt
that
he
and
the
band
had
the
same
tastes
and
soon
became
a
keen
fan
of
smile
in
late
1970
after
staffell
left
to
join
the
band
humpy
bong
the
remaining
smile
members
encouraged
by
bulsara
changed
their
name
to
queen
and
continued
working
together[4]
when
asked
about
the
name
bulsara
explained
i
thought
up
the
name
queen
it's
just
a
name
but
it's
very
regal
obviously
and
it
sounds
splendid
it's
a
strong
name
very
universal
and
immediate
it
had
a
lot
of
visual
potential
and
was
open
to
all
sorts
of
interpretations
i
was
certainly
aware
of
gay
connotations
but
that
was
just
one
facet
of
it[4]
the
band
had
a
number
of
bass
players
during
this
period
who
did
not
fit
with
the
band's
chemistry
it
was
not
until
february
1971
that
they
settled
on
john
deacon
and
began
to
rehearse
for
their
first
album
they
recorded
four
of
their
own
songs
liar

yourself
alive
the
night

two

for

a

for

embrace
a
stylised

the

rests
atop
the
letter
with
flames
rising
directly
above
it
and
the
fairies
are
each
sheltering
below
a

there
is
also
a
crown
inside
the
q
and
the
whole

is
overshadowed
by

resemblance
to

of

with

supporters[8]

may
was
also
scathing
of
prenter
who
was
mercury's
manager
from

for

of
the

of

because

i
remember
thinking
'oh
great
they've
picked

up'
and
then
i
thought
'this

this
is
a

artistic
influence
from

the
who

composed
music
that
drew
inspiration
from
many
different
genres
of

and
a
day
at

some
of
the

work
for
the
development

and
their
engineer
mike

there
are
over
180
vocal
overdubs
in

rhapsody[220]
many
queen

was

any

the
statement
'no
synths'
was
printed
on

of

in

many
people
couldn't

the

between
a
