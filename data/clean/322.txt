rye
by

'the
song
“comin’
thro’
the
rye”
asks
if
it
is
wrong
for
two
people
to
have
a
romantic
encounter
out
in
the
fields
away
from
the
public
eye
even
if
they
don’t
plan
to
have
a
commitment
to
one
another'
i
thought
the
'rye'
referred
to
in
robert
burns'
poem
was
the
river
rye
hence
the
lines
'jenny's
a
wet
poor
body
jenny's
seldom
dry'
in
this
regard
it
is
about
two
people
who
meet
at
a
river
with
no
crossing
which
will
cause
people
to
question
why
one
of
them
is
wet
and
what
they
have
been
doing

i
have
found
one
very
important
quotation
from
this
novel
to
have
been
left
out
on
this
page
it
is
very
useful
for
many
papers
and
is
a
very
important
quotation!
chapter
25
(towards
the
end)
the
thing
with
kids
is
if
they
want
to
grab
for
the
gold
ring
you
have
to
let
them
do
it
and
not
say
anything
if
they
fall
off
they
fall
off
but
it's
bad
if
you
say
anything
to
them
this
occurs
while
holden
is
watching
phoebe
ride
the
carousel
in
central
park
and
fears
phoebe
will
fall
off
her
house
while
reaching
for

rye
means
a

of
rye
remember
that
this
is
a
sexuallythemed
poem
when
burns
says
that
jenny
is
rarely
dry
he
is
referring
to
her
vaginal
lubrication
jenny
is
sexually
active
so
her
genitals
are
seldom
dry
