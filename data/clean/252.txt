sound
during
the

all
of
their

hits

in

the
story
is
told
that
they
were
going
to
lip

to
a
record
in
the
local
gaumont
cinema
(as

had
done

response
from
the
audience
that

renamed

thus
the

not

was
however
on
the
verge
of
dropping
them
from
the

because
of

over

later
acknowledged
that
this
enabled

to
greatly
improve
their
skills
as
recording
artists
during
this
productive
time
they
recorded
a
large
batch
of

that
would
become

the
cracks
began

show
within

robin
began
to
feel
that
stigwood
had
been
favouring
barry
as
the
frontman
their
next
album
which
was
to
have
been
a
concept
album
called
masterpeace
evolved
into
the
doublealbum
odessa
most
rock
critics
felt
this
was
the
best
bee

album
of
the
'60s
with
its
progressive
rock
feel
on
the
title

have
been
the
aside
robin
quit
the

the

were
in

rut
the

life

and
its

single
saw
a

sold
poorly
with

this
was
followed
by
an

(known
as

a

was
released
in

though
it
did

on
the
advice
of

head
of
their
us
label

stigwood
arranged
for
the
group
to
record
with
famed
soul
music
producer
arif
mardin
the
resulting
lp
mr

included
fewer
ballads
and
foreshadowed
the
rb
direction
of
the
rest
of
their
career
but
when
it
too
failed
to
attract
much
interest
mardin
encouraged
them
to
work
with
the
soul
music
style
the
brothers
attempted
to
assemble
a
live
stage
band
that
could
replicate
their
studio
sound
lead
guitarist
alan
kendall
had
come
on
board
in
1971
but
did
not
have
much
to
do
until
mr
natural
for
that
album
they
added
drummer
dennis
bryon
and
they
later
added

completing
the
late

who
had
previously
performed
on

now
confined

(19751981)
at

clapton's
suggestion
the
brothers
relocated
to
miami
florida
early
in
1975
to
record
music
after
starting
off
with
ballads
they
eventually
heeded
the
urging
of
mardin
and

and
crafted
more
rhythmic
disco
songs
including
their
second

along
with

no
7
nights
on

the
band
liked
the
resulting
new
sound
and
this
time
the
public
agreed
sending
the
lp
main
course
up
the
charts
this
was
the
first
bee

album
to
have
two

since
1968's
idea
main

also
became
their
first
charting
rb

mardin
was
unable
to
work
with
the
group
afterwards
but
the
bee
gees
enlisted
albhy
galuten
and
karl
richardson
who
had
worked
with
mardin
during
the
main
course
sessions
this
production
team
would
carry
the
bee
gees
through
the
rest
of
the
1970s
the
next
album
children
of
the
world
was
drenched
in
barry's
newfound
falsetto
and
weaver's
synthesiser
disco
licks
led
off
by
the
single
you
should
be
dancing
it
pushed
the
bee
gees
to
a
level
of
stardom
they
had
not
previously
achieved
in
the
us
though
their
new
rb/disco
sound
was
not
as
popular
with
some
die
hard
fans
from
the
1960s
the
bee
gees'
band
was
now
closer
to
a
rock
act
with

and
real
drums

the
bestselling
soundtrack
album
of
all
time
following
a
successful
live
album
here
at
last
bee
gees
live
the
bee
gees
agreed
with
stigwood
to
participate
in
the
creation
of
the
saturday
night
fever
soundtrack
it
would
be
the
turning
point
of
their
career
the
cultural
impact
of
both
the
film
and
the
soundtrack
was
seismic
not
only
in
the
united
states
but
in
the
rest
of
the
world
as
well
bringing
the
nascent
disco
scene
mainstream
the
band's
involvement
in
the
film
did
not
begin
until
postproduction
as
john
travolta
asserted
the
bee
gees
weren't
even
involved
in
the
movie
in
the
beginning&nbsp
i
was

and

producer
robert
stigwood
commissioned
the
bee
gees
to
create
the
songs
for
the
film
the
brothers
wrote
the
songs
virtually
in
a
single
weekend
at
france's
ch&acircteau
d'h&eacuterouville
studio[11]
barry
gibb
remembered
the
reaction
when
stigwood
and
music
supervisor
bill
oakes
arrived
and
listened
to
the
demos
they
flipped
out
and
said
these
will
be
great
we
still
had
no
concept
of
the
movie
except
some
kind
of
rough
script
that
they'd
brought
with
them&nbsp
you've
got
to
remember
we
were
fairly
dead
in
the
water
at
that
point
1975
somewhere
in
that
zone—the
bee
gees'
sound
was
basically
tired
we
needed
something
new
we
hadn't
had
a
hit
record
in
about
three
years
so
we
felt
oh
jeez
that's
it
that's
our
life
span
like
most
groups
in
the
late
60s
so
we
had
to
find
something
we
didn't
know
what
was
going
to
happen[11]
bill
oakes
who
supervised
the
soundtrack
asserts
that
saturday
night
fever
did
not
begin
the
disco
craze
rather
it
prolonged
it
disco
had
run
its
course
these
days
fever
is
credited
with
kicking
off
the
whole
disco
thing—it
really
didn't
truth
is
it
breathed
new
life
into
a
genre
that
was
actually
dying[11]
three

around
the

launching
the
most
popular
period
of
the
disco
era
they
also
penned
the
song

i
can't
have

which
became
a

for

elliman
while
the

gees'
own

was
the
bside
of

such
was
the
popularity
of
saturday
night
fever
that
two
different

of
the
song
more
than

received
airplay
one
by
the
bee
gees
which
was
relegated
to

and
another
by

was

the

was
inescapable
during
an
eightmonth
period
beginning
in
the

of

six

the

by
the
end
of

disco
was
rapidly
declining
in
popularity
and
the
backlash
against

put
the

american
career
in
a
tailspin
radio
stations
around

began
promoting

free
weekends
following
their
remarkable
run
from

to

the

would
have
only

in

and
that
would
not
come
until
1989
the
bee
gees'
international
popularity
sustained
somewhat
less
damage
barry
gibb
considered
the
success
of
the
saturday
night
fever
soundtrack
both
a
blessing
and
a
curse
fever
was

remember
people
climbing

lost
the

one

said
that
a
factor
in

was
the

failure
to
introduce
expert
testimony
rebutting
the

expert
testimony
that
