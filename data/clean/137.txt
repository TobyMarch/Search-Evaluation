&raquoif
you
know
nothing
else
about
inception
at
least
know
this
it
is
not
a
trick
it
is
ingenious
but
not
crafty
knotty
but
not
duplicitous
it
has
neither
memento’s
method
conceit
nor
the
smoke
and
mirrors
of
the
prestige
to
contrast
it
with
the
latter
in
particular
(fine
film
though
that
is)
is
to
appreciate
the
difference
between
stagemagic
and
a
real
miracle
the
directorasmagician
analogy
feels
least
tired
when
applied
to
christopher
nolan
given
his
body
of
work
its
formal
and
mental
layers
and
precisely
engineered
reveals
at
best
this
approach
can
be
exhilarating
at
worst
—
as
with
the
narrative
dripfeed
of
insomnia
his
weakest
picture
—
it
is
obfuscation
masquerading
as
artistry
aka
not
half
as
bloody
clever
as
it
thinks
it
is
given
its
setting
is
largely
the
subconscious
though
inception
can’t
work
with
a
rugpull
denouement
every
scene
—
let
alone
the
movie
—
could
be
punctured
with
that
postscript
beloved
of
primary
school
story
scribblers
“and
i
woke
up
and
it
was
only
a
dream”
so
don’t
brace
for
a
“tadah!”
moment
—
it
will
impede
your
enjoyment
and
waste
your
time
instead
marvel
at
the
effrontery
of
a
filmmaker
who
asks
you
to
emotionally
invest
in
avowed
mental
constructs
—
and
succeeds
in
one
sense
admittedly
this
is
what
every
filmmaker
asks
us
to
do
engross
ourselves
in
their
imagination
the
movie
then
could
be
interpreted
as
being
about
craft
and
inspiration
—
one
character
even
says
of
constructing
the
architecture
of
dreams
“it’s
just
pure
creation”
but
there
are
bigger
things
in
play
here
than
simply
art
and
nolan
isn’t
given
to
selfreferential
indulgence
this
is
about
life
and
death
and
what
might
be
beyond
and
between
it
is
also
about
blazing
gun
battles
zerogravity
fist
fights
and
stars
you’d
like
to
sleep
with
fret
not
batfans
—
nolan
hasn’t
turned
into
andrei
tarkovsky
the
muscular
action
that
distinguished
his
bruce
wayne
pictures
is
again
in
evidence
but
whereas
gotham
in
the
nolanverse
is
bound
by
at
least
some
constraints
—
you
know
little
things
like
physics
—
here
all
bets
are
off
it’s
not
that
inception
doesn’t
have
rules
like
any
convincing
sciencefiction
it
has
rules
and
boundaries
it
will
not
break
but
those
boundaries
are
pretty
broad
—
they
are
the
limits
of
each
character’s
imagination
the
images
deserve
to
be
untarnished
by
much
explanation
—
you
should
see
them
for
yourself
and
on
the
biggest
screen
you
can
(it’s
coming
to
imax
—
book
now)
to
best
appreciate
wally
pfister’s
excellent
expansive
photography
funny
though
how
moments
that
make
the
memory
boggle
when
you
recall
them
pass
naturally
in
the
moment
because
you
are
rooted
in
the
world
nolan
has
created
in
the
reality(s)
of
the
characters
this
is
testament
to
the
physical
prowess
of
the
production
and
thorough
thought
that’s
created
this
world
but
also
to
the
actors
some
rise
to
particularly
fascinating
challenges
(hello
tom
berenger)
and
some
surprise
—
principally
cillian
murphy
who
can
do
danger
and
insolence
in
his
sleep
but
here
shows
a
tenderness
and
vulnerability
crucial
to
the
story
others
exert
a
personality
and
appeal
on
parts
that
on
the
page
would
have
played
very
close
to
‘types’
—
particularly
ellen
page
exuding
a
prim
sexiness
as
really
basil
exposition
and
joseph
gordonlevitt
who
somehow
manages
to
appear
both
ambiguous
and
dependable
as
essentially
a
sidekick
the
pair
share
one
of
the
movie’s
best
comic
beats
too
though
most
of
the
sly
laughs
come
from
tom
hardy’s
roguish
eames
it
will
be
fascinating
to
read
the
hypotheses
that
percolate
about
inception
after
release
and
no
doubt
what
characters
are
called
will
be
explored
that
page
is
ariadne
—
the
name
of
a
figure
in
greek
myth
who
guides
a
hero
from
a
maze
—
has
already
been
noted
eames
shares
his
name
with
seminal
designers/architects
charles
and
ray
who
made
a
celebrated
short
film
powers
of
10
about
the
magnitude
of
the
universe
marion
cotillard
is
cobb’s
wife
mal
—
which
means
“bad”
but
can
also
derive
from
the
hebrew
for
messenger
or
angel
cobb
itself
comes
from
jacob
who
when
fleeing
from
his
murderous
brother
in
the
biblical
book
genesis
dreamt
of
a
ladder
to
heaven
based
on
his
previous
behaviour
nolan
isn’t
likely
to
explain
what
he
thinks
inception
is
actually
about
but
it’s
certainly
possible
to
see
it
as
a
blockbuster
allegory
about
grief
faith
and
the
desire
for
an
afterlife
—
to
be
reunited
with
those
we
love
and
have
lost
(those
with
even
a
passing
knowledge
of
catholicism
may
note
an
interesting
use
of
the
word
‘limbo’)
you
could
argue
it’s
about
suicide
and
the
fears
and
hopes
that
can
both
power
and
prevent
it
(for
in
that
sleep
of
death
what
dreams
may
come?)
just
as
was
soderbergh’s
solaris
nolan
though
doesn’t
muse
he
motors
this
is
no
sombre
meditation
the
themes
are
there
to
be
explored
(there
will
be
more
theories
about
this
movie
than
about
the
killing
of
jfk)
but
you
can
just
as
well
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
spectacle
and
what
a
spectacle
in
terms
of
scale
and
style
it
is
as
nolan
intended
comparable
to
bond’s
best
excursions
—
yet
filtered
through
a
brainfrying
subconsciousspelunking
timedilating
structure
that
boldly
frames
action
sequences
around
each
other
so
we
get
an
explosive
arctic
mountain
vaultstorming
within
a
zerogravity
scramble
within
a
vehiclecrunching
chase
in
effect
the
setpieces
are
simultaneous
which
is
insane
but
brilliant
as
while
he
at
times
boggles
through
the
necessarily
complex
editing
nolan
never
corrupts
his
multiverse’s
internal
logic
when
you’re
not
basking
in
the
visuals
you
can
always
lean
into
dicaprio
and
appreciate
the
emotion
he
anchors
everything
an
actor
who
has
long
borne
the
blessing
and
the
burden
of
being
hailed
a
genius
before
he
was
even
a
man
he
has
never
been
less
than
good
but
can
appear
either
callow
or
tryhard
like
a
child
dressing
in
daddy’s
suit
not
here
he
shows
a
depth
of
feeling
rivalled
only
by
his
work
in
shutter
island
to
deliver
two
such
turns
in
a
career
would
be
impressive
in
a
year
it’s
just
showing
off
what
makes
it
work
really
though
is
how
unfussy
he
is
how
unselfish
—
there’s
no
showboating
good
as
he
is
in
the
departed
or
gangs
of
new
york
you
could
sometimes
feel
the
weight
of
his
acting
here
paradoxically
he
appears
effortless
even
though
he’s
the
beam
on
which
the
whole
mighty
edifice
rests
it’s
because
you
believe
his
journey
his
heart
that
you
buy
into
inception
if
he
failed
so
would
the
movie
this
isn’t
the
sort
of
performance
that
usually
wins
oscars
—
it’s
not
ostentatious
or
superficially
transformative
but
by
god
it
is
brilliant
the
strength
of
it
is
that
you
remain
emotionally
engaged
even
if
you’re
not
entirely
sure
what’s
going
on
the
third
act
makes
memento
seem
about
as
complex
as
bear
in
the
big
blue
house
and
while
there
is
remarkable
clarity
given
the
complexity
you
are
pummelled
with
information
and
have
to
keep
up
—
pay
attention
figure
it
out
only
repeat
viewing
will
reveal
if
this
comparison
is
truly
justified
but
it
feels
like
stanley
kubrick
adapting
the
work
of
the
great
scifi
author
william
gibson
(neuromancer)
—
except
nolan
appears
to
like
people
more
than
the
2001
auteur
so
you
have
a
film
that
embraces
intellect
and
emotion
but
also
sheer
entertainment
—
that
can
include
a
character
staring
at
what
looks
like
one
of
francis
bacon’s
tortured
selfportraits
but
also
has
the
best
explodey
building
sequence
since
zabriskie
point
that
film
was
a
notorious
bomb
ignored
by
audiences
and
pilloried
by
critics
and
some
who
may
find
inception
expositionheavy
and
bewildering
will
no
doubt
argue
that
drunk
on
the
freedom
of
the
dark
knight
nolan
has
spent
$170
million
disappearing
up
his
own
arse
he
hasn’t
on
this
form
wherever
he
goes
next
be
it
batman
3
or
something
else
we’ll
be
the
first
in
line
to
follow
verdict
like
the
matrix
mated
with
synecdoche
new
york
—
or
a
charlie
kaufman
007
to
paraphrase
casino
royale’s
vesper
lynd
it’s
a
meaningful
pursuit
in
a
summer
of
disposable
entertainments
with
physicsdefying
thunderous
action
heartwringing
emotion
and

astonishing

what
can
i
say
this
is
a
phenomenal
film!!!
and
i
genuinely
mean
that
christopher
nolan
just
keeps
on
getting
better
however
before
i
thought
nolan
movies
were
slightly
overrated
with
the
particular
likes
of
mememto
and
the
dark
knight
they
were
good
movies
but
not
exceptional
in
my
opinion
whereas
inception
blew
me
away
in
terms
of
the
action
the
well
constructed
story
telling
as
well
as
the
idea
of
dream
invasion
and
the
'deam
within
a
dream'
which
i
thought
was
genius
and
intriguing

blu

just
watched
it
on
bd
and
can't
ever
remember
seeing
a
more
perfect
film
visually
whilst
it
is
extremely
complex
in
areas
such
as
how
the
detail
contained
within
your
subconscious
mind
is
diluted
through
3
layers
to
your

self
i
have
to
say
that
i
do
think
it
is
a
tour
de
force
of
original
film
making
and
sets
a
new
watermark
for
intelligent
blockbusters
and
empire
your

it
is
as
emotional
as
