i
like
it
how
you
can
see
(hear)
their
evolution
in
music
troughout
all
their
albums
if
listening
to
the
pre
dsotm
work
they
seem
to
be
serching
for
that
spark
after
they
lost
syd
and
found
it
in
middle
fat
old
sun
fof
instance
feels
really
like
it
was
made
in
the
late
70's
when
they
were
all
in
sync
something
special
there
