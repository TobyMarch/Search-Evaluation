1970–87
early
life
and
struggles
mariah
carey
was
born
in
huntington
new
york
on
march
27
1970[2]her
father
alfred
roy
was
of
african
american
and
venezuelan
(including
afrovenezuelan)
descent
while
her
mother
patricia
(n&eacutee
hickey)
is
of
irish
descent[3]
patricia's
father
had
died
while
she
was
young
however
she
inherited
his
passion
for
music[3]
she
developed
a
career
as
an
occasional
opera
singer
and
vocal
coach
and
met
alfred
in
1960[2]
as
he
began
earning
a
living
as
an
aeronautical
engineer
the
couple
wed
later
that
year
and
moved
into
a
small
suburb
in
new
york[3]
after
the
pair's
elopement
patricia's
family
disowned
her
due
to
marrying
a
man
of
color
carey
later
explained
that
growing
up
she
felt
a
notion
of
neglect
from
her
maternal
family
a
mark
that
affected
her
greatly
so
later
i
was
like
'well
where
does
this
leave
me?
am
i
a
bad
person?'
you
know
it's
still
not
that
common
to
be
a
multiracial
person
but
i'm
happy
with
the
combination
of
things
that
i
am[3]
during
the
interval
of
years
in
between
carey's
older
sister
allison
and
the
singer's
birth
the
carey
family
experienced
personal
struggles
within
the
community
due
to
their
ethnicity[3]
carey's
name
was
derived
from
the
song
they
call
the
wind
mariah
originally
from
the
1951
broadway
musical
paint
your
wagon[4][5]
when
carey
was
three
years
old
her
parents
divorced
due
to
the
increasingly
strenuous
nature
of
their
marriage[6]
it's
been
difficult
for
me
moving
around
so
much
having
to
grow
up
by
myself
my
parents
divorced
and
i
always
felt
kind
of
different
from
everybody
else
in
my
neighborhoods
i
was
a
different
person
ethnically
and
sometimes
that
can
be
a
problem
if
you
look
a
certain
way
everybody
goes
'white
girl'
and
i'd
go
'no
that's
not
what
i
am'
—carey
on
the
difficulty
of
her
childhood[7]
after
their
separation
allison
moved
in
with
her
father
while
the
other
two
children
remained
with
their
mother[6]
as
the
years
passed
carey
would
grow
apart
from
her
father
and
would
later
stop
seeing
him
altogether[6][8]
by
the
age
of
four
carey
recalled
that
she
had
begun
to
sneak
the
radio
under
her
covers
at
night
and
just
sing
from
her
heart
and
try
and
find
peace
within
the
music[8]
during
elementary
school
she
would
excel
in
subjects
that
she
enjoyed
such
as
literature
art
and
music
while
not
finding
interest
in
other
subjects[9]
after
several
years
of
financial
struggling
patricia
earned
enough
money
to
move
her
family
into
a
stable
and
more
affluent
sector
in
new
york[9]
carey
had
begun
writing
poems
and
adding
melodies
to
them
thus
starting
as
a
singersongwriter
while
attending
harborfields
high
school
in
greenlawn
new
york[10][10]
even
from
a
young
age
carey
excelled
in
her
music
and
demonstrated
usage
of
the
whistle
register
though
only
beginning
to
master
and
control
it
through
her
training
with
her
mother[10]
though
opening
her
daughter
to
the
world
of
classical
opera
patricia
never
pressured
carey
to
pursue
a
career
in
that
type
of
genre
as
she
never
seemed
interested
in
that
world
of
music[10]
carey
recalled
that
she
kept
her
singersongwriter
works
a
secret
and
noted
that
patricia
had
never
been
a
pushy
mom
she
never
said
'give
it
more
of
an
operatic
feel'
i
respect
opera
like
crazy
but
it
didn't
influence
me[10][11]
while
a
high
school
student
carey
developed
a
relationship
with
gavin
christopher
with
whom
she
shared
musical
aspirations
the
songwriting
duo
needed
an
assistant
who
could
play
the
keyboard
we
called
someone
and
he
couldn't
come
so
by
accident
we
stumbled
upon
ben
[margulies]
ben
came
to
the
studio
and
he
really
couldn't
play
the
keyboards
very
well

he
was
really
more
of
a
drummer

but
after
that
day
we
kept
in
touch
and
we
sort
of
clicked
as
writers[11]
carey
and
christopher
began
writing
and
composing
songs
in
his
father's
store
basement
during
carey's
senior
year
after
composing
their
first
song
together
here
we
go
round
again
which
carey
described
as
having
a
motownvibe
they
continued
writing
material
for
a
full
length
demo[12]
following
her
graduation
from
high
school
carey's
mother
remarried
which
ultimately
prompted
her
to
move
out
from
their
apartment
she
began
living
in
a
one
bedroom
studio
in
manhattan
which
she
shared
with
four
other
female
students[13][14]
during
this
time
carey
worked
as
a
waitress
for
various
restaurants
usually
getting
fired
after
two
week
intervals[15]
while
requiring
work
to
pay
for
her
rent
carey's
mind
and
effort
still
remained
with
her
musical
ambitions
as
she
continued
working
late
into
the
night
with
margulies
in
hopes
of
completing
a
demo
take
that
could
be
passed
on
to
record
executives[15]
after
completing
her
four
song
demo
tape
carey
attempted
to
pass
it
to
music
labels
but
was
met
with
failure
each
time[16]
shortly
thereafter
she
was
introduced
to
rising
pop
singer
brenda
k
starr[16][17]
1988–92
recording
debut
and
career
beginnings
carey
exiting
the
shepherd's
bush
theatre
after
promoting
her
single
vision
of
love
on
the
wogan
show
in
1990
as
carey's
friendship
with
starr
grew
so
did
her
interest
in
helping
carey
succeed
in
the
industry[18]
on
a
friday
night
in
november
1987
carey
accompanied
starr
to
a
record
executives
gala
where
she
handed
her
demo
tape
to
tommy
mottola
head
of
columbia
records
who
listened
to
it
on
his
way
back
home[18][19]
after
the
first
two
songs
he
became
so
enamored
at
the
sound
and
quality
of
carey's
voice
that
he
turned
around
returned
to
the
event
only
to
find
that
she
had
left[19]
in
what
has
been
widely
described
by
critics
as
a
modern
day
cinderellalike
tale[20][21]
after
searching
for
carey
for
two
weeks
and
eventually
contacting
her
through
starr's
management
he
immediately
signed
her
and
began
mapping
out
her
debut
into
mainstream
music[18]
while
she
maintained
that
she
wanted
to
continue
working
with
margulies
mottola
enlisted
top
producers
of
the
time
including
ric
wake
narada
michael
walden
and
rhett
lawrence[18]
mottola
and
the
staff
at
columbia
had
planned
to
market
carey
as
the
main
female
pop
artist
on
their
roster
competing
with
the
likes
of
whitney
houston
and
madonna
who
were
signed
to
arista
and
sire
records
respectively[22]
after
the
completion
of
the
album
titled
mariah
carey
columbia
spent
an
upward
of
$1
million
to
promote
it[23]
though
opening
with
weak
sales
the
album
eventually
reached
the
top
of
the
billboard
200
after
carey's
exposure
at
the
33rd
annual
grammy
awards[24]
mariah
carey
stayed
atop
the
charts
for
eleven
consecutive
weeks[25]
and
she
won
the
best
new
artist
and
best
female
pop
vocal
performance
trophies
for
her
single
vision
of
love[26]
the
album
yielded
an
additional
three
number
one
singles
on
the
billboard
hot
100
following
the
four
week
numberone
run
of
vision
of
love
carey
became
the
first
artist
since
the
jackson
5
to
have
their
first
four
singles
reach
number
one[27]
mariah
carey
finished
as
the
bestselling
album
in
the
united
states
of
1991[28]
while
totaling
sales
of
over
15
million
copies[29]
carey
began
recording
her
second
studio
album
eventually
titled
emotions
in
1991[30][31]
the
album
as
carey
described
it
paid
homage
to
motown
soul
music
as
she
felt
the
need
to
pay
tribute
to
the
type
of
music
and
genre
that
truly
influenced
her
as
a
struggling
child[31]
for
the
project
carey
worked
with
walter
afanasieff
who
only
had
a
small
role
on
her
debut
as
well
as
clivill&eacutes
and
cole
from
the
dance
group
c+c
music
factory[32]
however
carey's
relationship
with
margulies
deteriorated[31]
over
a
contract
carey
had
signed
prior
to
her
signing
with
columbia
agreeing
to
split
not
only
the
songwriting
royalties
from
the
songs
but
half
of
her
earnings
as
well[31]
however
when
the
time
came
to
write
music
for
emotions
sony
officials
made
it
clear
he
would
only
be
paid
the
fair
amount
given
to
cowriters
on
an
album[31]
subsequently
margulies
filed
a
lawsuit
against
sony
which
ultimately
led
to
their
parting
of
ways[31]
on
september
17
1991
emotions
was
released
around
the
world
and
was
accepted
by
critics
as
a
more
mature
album
than
its
predecessor[33]
while
praised
for
carey's
improved
songwriting
production
and
new
sound
the
album
was
criticized
for
its
material
which
many
felt
was
noticeably
weaker
than
her
debut[34]
though
the
album
managed
sales
of
over
eight
million
copies
globally
emotions
failed
to
reach
the
commercial
and
critical
heights
of
its
predecessor[35]
as
they
had
done
after
the
release
of
her
debut
critics
once
again
questioned
whether
carey
would
embark
on
a
world
tour
in
promotion
for
her
material[36]
although
carey
explained
that
due
to
her
stage
fright
and
the
general
strenuous
nature
of
her
songs
a
tour
sounded
very
daunting
speculation
grew
that
carey
was
a
studio
worm
and
that
she
wasn't
capable
of
producing
the
perfect
pitch
and
5octave
vocal
range
for
which
she
was
known[20][37]
in
hopes
of
putting
any
claims
of
her
being
a
manufactured
artist
to
rest
carey
and
walter
afanasieff
decided
to
book
an
appearance
on
mtv
unplugged
a
television
program
aired
by
mtv[38]
the
show's
purpose
was
to
present
name
artists
and
feature
them
unplugged
or
stripped
of
studio
equipment[38][39]
while
carey
felt
strongly
of
her
more
soulful
and
powerful
songs
it
was
decided
that
her
most
popular
content
to
that
point
would
be
included[39]
days
prior
to
the
show's
taping
carey
and
afanasieff
thought
of
adding
a
cover
version
of
an
older
song
in
order
to
provide
something
different
and
unexpected[39]
they
chose
i'll
be
there
a
song
made
popular
by
the
jackson
5
in
1970
rehearsing
it
few
times
before
the
night
of
the
show
on
march
16
1992
carey
recorded
a
sevenpiece
setlist
at
kaufman
astoria
studios
in
queens
new
york[40]
the
revue
was
met
with
critical
acclaim
leading
to
it
being
aired
over
three
times
as
often
as
an
average
episode
would[41]
the
revue's
success
tempted
sony
officials
to
use
it
as
some
form
of

sony
decided
to
release
it
as
an
ep
selling
for
a
reduced
price
due
to
its
shorter
length[43]
the
ep
proved
to
be
a
success
contrary
to
critics
and
speculations
that
carey
was
just
a
studio
artist[43]
and
was
given
a
tripleplatinum
certification
by
the
recording
industry

of

first

music
box
and
daydream
the
writing
partnership
that
her
and
i
had
and
i
can't
speak
for
her
other
songwriting
partners
but
if
you
could
see
us
in
the
room
i
would
hit
a
chord
and
play
a
little
melody
on
the
piano
and
she
would
say
'oh
that's
nice'
and
she
would
sing
that
melody
and
then
she
adds
a
little
bit
to
it
i
would
then
play
it
back
and
then
she
would
say
'yea
that's
good'
so
it
instantly
becomes
this
partnership
where
eventually
she'll
have
a
melody
and
then
the
melody
would
prompt
her
to
start
thinking
about
this
feeling
she
wants
to
put
into
words
this
would
eventually
become
the
theme
of
the
song
—afanasieff
on
his
songwriting
partnership
with
carey[45]
during
early
1993
carey
began
working
on
her
third
studio
album
music
box[46]
after
emotions
failed
to
achieve
the
commercial
heights
of
her
debut
album
carey
and
columbia
came
to
the
agreement
that
the
next
album
would
contain
a
more
pop
influenced
sound
in
order
to
appeal
to
a
wider
audience[46]
during
carey's
writing
sessions
she
began
working
mostly
with
afanasieff
with
whom
she
cowrote
and
produced
most
of
music
box[45]
during
the
album's
recording
carey
and
mottola
became
romantically
involved[47]
they
wed
in
a
lavish
ceremony
on
june

1993

guests
including

on

music
box
was
released
around
the
world
debuting
at
numberone
on
the
billboard
200[49]
the
album
was
met
with
mixed
reception
from
music
critics
while
many
praised
the
album's
pop
influence
and
strong
content
others
felt
that
carey
made
less
usage
of
her
acclaimed
vocal
range[50]
ron
wynn
from
allmusic
described
carey's
different
form
of
singing
on
the
album
it
was
wise
for
carey
to
display
other
elements
of
her
approach
but
sometimes
excessive
spirit
is
preferable
to
an
absence
of
passion[51]
the
album's
second
single
hero
would
eventually
come
to
be
one
of
carey's
most
popular
and
inspirational
songs
of
her
career[52]
the
song
became
carey's
eighth
chart
topper
in
the
united
states[52]
and
began
expanding
carey's
popularity
throughout
europe
with
the
release
of
the
album's
third
single
carey
achieved
several
career
milestones
her
cover
of

music
box
spent
prolonged
periods
at
number
one
on
the
album
charts
of
several
countries[55]
and
eventually
became
one
of
the
bestselling
albums
of
all
time
with
worldwide
sales
of
over
32
million
copies[45]
after
declining
to
tour
for
her
past
two
albums
carey
agreed
to
embark
on
a
short
stateside
string
of
concerts
titled
the
music
box
tour[56]
spanning
only
six
dates
across
north
america[56]
the
short
but
successful
tour
was
a
large
step
for
carey
who
dreaded
the
hassle
of
touring[57]
following
music
box
carey
took
a
relatively
large
period
of
time
away
from
the
public
eye
and
began
working
on
an
unknown
project
throughout
1994[58]
the
project
was
kept
very
secretive
until
billboard
announced
on
their
october
issue
that
carey
would
release
a
holiday
album
later
that
year[58]
in
late
1994
carey
recorded
a
duet
with
luther
vandross
a
cover
of
lionel
richie
and
diana
ross's
endless
love[59]
by
that
point
columbia
felt
carey
had
already
established
herself
as
a
pop
singer
and
vocalist
but
wanted
to
try
and
feature
her
as
more
of
an
entertainer[60]
through
the
release
of
merry
christmas
columbia
hoped
that
audiences
would
buy
carey's
material
solely
for
her
name
and
reputation
and
squash
fears
of
her
being
a
typical
pop
singer[60]
the
album
was
released
on
november

1994
on
the
same
day
that
the
album's
first

eventually

that

caused

to

went
into
detail
on

after
the
release
of
daydream
and
the
success
that
followed
carey
began
focusing
on
her
personal
life
which
was
a
constant
struggle
at
the
time[82]
carey's
relationship
with
mottola
began
to
deteriorate
due
to
their
growing
creative
differences
in
terms
of
her
albums
as
well
as
his
controlling
nature[82]
with
each
following
album
and
her
continual
established
fame
and
popularity
carey
began
to
take
more
initiative
and
control
with
her
music
and
started
infusing
more
genres
into
her
work[83]
during
mid1997
carey
was
well
underway
writing
and
recording
material
for
her
next
album
butterfly
(1997)[84]
she
sought
to
work
with
other
producers
and
writers
other
than
afansieff
such
as
sean
combs
kamaal
fareed
missy
elliott
and
jean
claude
oliver
and
samuel
barnes
from
trackmasters[84]
during
the
album's
recording
carey
and
mottola
separated
with
carey
citing
is
as
her
way
of
achieving
freedom
and
a
new
lease
on
life[85]
aside
from
the
album's
different
approach
critics
took
notice
of
carey's
altered
style
of
singing
which
she
describe
as
breathy
vocals[86]
her
newfound
style
of
singing
was
met
with
mixed
reception
some
critics
felt
is
was
a
sign
of
maturity
that
she
didn't
feel
the
need
to
always
show
off
her
upper
range[87]
while
others
felt
it
was
a
sign
of
her
weakening
and
waning
voice[88][89]
the
album's
lead
single
honey
and
its
accompanying
music
video
introduced
a
more
overtly
sexual
image
than
carey
had
ever
demonstrated
and
furthered
reports
of
her
freedom
from
mottola[90]
carey
stated
that
butterfly
marked
the
point
when
she
attained
full
creative
control
over
her
music[91]
however
she
added
i
don't
think
that
it's
that
much
of
a
departure
from
what
i've
done
in
the
past
[]
it's
not
like
i
went
psycho
and
thought
i
would
be
a
rapper
personally
this
album
is
about
doing
whatever
the
hell
i
wanted
to
do[90]
growing
creative
differences
with
producer
afanasieff
continued
and
eventually
ended
their
working
relationship
after
collaborating
on
most
of
carey's
material[92]
reviews
for
butterfly
were
generally
positive
rolling

wrote
it's
not
as
if
carey
has
totally
dispensed
with
her
old
saccharine
houstonstyle

the
predominant
mood
of

allmusic
editor
stephen

erlewine
described
carey's
vocals
as
sultrier
and
more
controlled
than
ever
and
heralded
butterfly
as
her
best
record
and
illustrates
that
carey
continues
to
improve
and
refine
her
music
which
makes
her
a
rarity
among
her
'90s
peers[94]
the
album
was
a
commercial
success
although
not
to
the
degree
of
her
previous
three
albums[92]
toward
the
turn
of
the
millennium
carey
began
developing
other
projects

of
which
she

able
to
during

carey
had
begun
developing

later
retitled
to

to

for

to

for
the
commercially
favorable
holiday
season[98]
however
they
disagreed
as
to
what
content
and
singles
should
constitute
the
album[99]
sony
wanted
to
release
an
album
that
featured
her
number
one
singles
in
the
united
states
and
her
international
chart
toppers
on
the
european
versions
void
of
any
new
material
while
carey
felt
that
a
compilation
album
should
reflect
on
her
most
personal
songs
not
just
her
most
commercial[99]
she
felt
that
not
including
any
new
material
would
result
in
cheating
her
fans
therefore
including
four
new
songs
that
she
had
recorded[99]
while

carey
often
expressed
distaste
towards
the

selection
expressing
her
disappointment
in
the
omission
of
her
favorite

the

throughout
early2000
carey's
troubled
relationship
with
columbia
grew
as
they
halted
promotion
after
the
album's
first
two
singles[108]
they
felt
rainbow
didn't
have
any
strong
single
to
be
released
whereas
carey
wanted
a
ballad
regarding
personal
and
inner
strength
released[108]
the
difference
in
opinion
led
to
a
very
public
feud
as
carey
began
posting
messages
on
her
webpage
in
early
and
mid2000
telling
fans
inside
information
on
the
dispute
as
well
as
instructing
them
to
request
can't
take
that
away
(mariah's
theme)
on
radio
stations[109]
one
of
the
messages
carey
left
on
her
page
read
basically
a
lot
of
you
know
the
political
situation
in
my
professional
career
is
not
positive
it's
been
really
really
hard
i
don't
even
know
if
this
message
is
going
to
get
to
you
because
i
don't
know
if
they
want
you
to
hear
this
i'm
getting
a
lot
of
negative
feedback
from
certain
corporate
people
but
i
am
not
willing
to
give
up[110]
fearing
to
lose
their
label's
highest
seller
sony
chose
to
release
the
song[110]
carey
initially
content
with
the
agreement
soon
found
out
that
the
song
had
only
been
given
a
very
limited
and
lowpromotion
release
which
made
charting
extremely
difficult
and
unlikely[110]
critical
reception
of
rainbow
was
generally
enthusiastic
with
the
sunday
herald
saying
that
the
album
sees
her
impressively
tottering
between
soul
ballads
and
collaborations
with

a

$100&nbspmillion

with

(emi

carey
was
given
full
conceptual
and
creative
control
over
the
project[114]
she
opted
to
record
an
album
partly
mixed
with
1980s
influenced
disco
and
other
similar
genres
in
order
to
go
handinhand
with
the
film's
setting[115]
she
often
stated
that
columbia
had
regarded
her
as
a
commodity
with
her
separation
from
mottola
exacerbating
her
relations
with
label
executives
just
a
few
months
later
in
july
2001
it
was
widely
reported
that
carey
had
suffered
a
physical
and
emotional
breakdown
she
had
left
messages
on
her
website
that
complained
of
being
overworked[116]
and
her
relationship
with
the
latin
icon
luis
miguel
ended[117]
in
an
interview
the
following
year
she
said
i
was
with
people
who
didn't
really
know
me
and
i
had
no
personal
assistant
i'd
do
interviews
all
day
long
and
get
two
hours
of
sleep
a
night
if
that[118]
due
to
the
pressure
from
the
media
her
heavy
work
schedule
and
the
split
from
miguel
carey
began
posting
a
series
of
disturbing
messages
on
her
official
website
and
displayed
erratic
behavior
on
several
live
promotional
outings[119]
on
july&nbsp19&nbsp2001
carey
made
a
surprise
appearance
on
the
mtv
program
total
request
live
(trl)[120]
as
the
show's
host
carson
daly
began
taping
following
a
commercial
break
carey
came
out
pushing
an
ice
cream
cart
while
wearing
a
large
men's
shirt
and
began
a
striptease
in
which
she
shed
her
shirt
to
reveal
a
tight
yellow
and
green
ensemble[120]
while
she
later
revealed
that
daly
was
aware
of
her
presence
in
the
building
prior
to
her
appearance
carey's
appearance
on
trl
garnered
strong
media
attention[119]
only
days
later
carey
began
posting
irregular
voice
notes
and
messages
on
her
official
website
i'm
trying
to
understand
things
in
life
right
now
and
so
i
really
don't
feel
that
i
should
be
doing
music
right
now
what
i'd
like
to
do
is
just
a
take
a
little
break
or
at
least
get
one
night
of
sleep
without
someone
popping
up
about
a
video
all
i
really
want
is
[to]
just
be
me
and
that's
what
i
should
have
done
in
the
first
place

i
don't
say
this
much
but
guess
what
i
don't
take
care
of
myself[120]
following
the
quick
removal
of
the
messages
berger
commented
that
carey
had
been
obviously
exhausted
and
not
thinking
clearly
when
she
posted
the
letters[121]
on
july&nbsp26
she
was
suddenly
hospitalized
citing
extreme
exhaustion
and
a
physical
and
emotional
breakdown[122]
carey
was
inducted
at
an
undisclosed
hospital
in
connecticut
and
remained
hospitalized
and
under
doctor's
care
for
two
weeks
followed
by
an
extended
absence
from
the
public[122]
following
the
heavy
media
coverage
surrounding
carey's
publicized
breakdown
and
hospitalization
virgin
records
and
20th
century
fox
delayed
the
release
of
both
glitter
as
well
as
its
soundtrack
of
the
same
name[123]
consequently
critics
suggested
that
in
delaying
glitter
hype
for
the
project
would
have
largely
subsided
and
would
possibly
hurt
both
ticket
and
album
sales[124]
when
discussing
the
project's
weak
commercial
reaction
carey
blamed
both
her
frame
of
mind
during
the
time
of
its
release
its
postponement
as
well
as
the
soundtrack
having
been
released
on
september
11[125]
critics
panned
glitter
as
well
as
its
accompanying
soundtrack
both
were
unsuccessful
commercially[126]
the
accompanying
soundtrack
album
glitter
became
carey's
lowestselling
album
to
that
point
the
st
louis
postdispatch
dismissed
it
as
an
absolute
mess
that'll
go
down
as
an
annoying
blemish
on
a
career
that
while
not
always
critically
heralded
was
at
least
nearly
consistently
successful[127]
following
the
negative
cloud
that
was
ensuing
carey's
personal
life
at
the
time
as
well
as
the
project's
poor
reception
her
unprecedented
$100&nbspmillion
fivealbum
record
deal
with
virgin
records
(emi
records)
was
bought
out
for
$50&nbspmillion[114][128]
soon
after
carey
flew
to
capri
italy
for
a
period
of
five
months
in
which
she
began
writing
material
for
her
new
album
stemming
from
all
the
personal
experiences
she
had
endured
throughout
the
past
year[119]
carey
later
said
that
her
time
at
virgin
was
a
complete
and
total
stressfest
[]
i
made
a
total
snap
decision
which
was
based
on
money
and
i
never
make
decisions
based
on
money
i
learned
a
big
lesson
from
that[129]
later
that
year
she
signed
a
contract
with
island
records
valued
at
more
than
$24&nbspmillion[130]
and
launched
the
record
label
monarc
to
add
further
to
carey's
emotional
burdens
her
father
with
whom
she
had
little
contact
since

died
of
cancer
that
year[131]

who
costarred
as

at
a

restaurant
it
premiered
at

and
received
generally
negative
critical
response
though
carey's
portrayal
of
the
character
was
praised
roger
friedman
of
fox
news
referred
to
her
as
a
thelma
ritter
for
the
new
millennium
and
wrote
her
line
delivery
is
sharp
and
she
manages
to
get
the
right
laughs[132]
later
that
year
carey
performed
the
american
national
anthem
to
rave
reviews
at

carey
released
her
next
studio
album

she
said
marked
a
new
lease
on

for
her[118]
though
released
in
the
wake
of
glitter
and
carey's
return
to
the
music
scene
sales
of
charmbracelet
were
moderate
and
the
quality
of
carey's
vocals
came
under
criticism
joan
anderson
from
the
boston
globe
declared
the
album
the
worst
of
her
career
and
revealed
a
voice
[that
is]
no
longer
capable
of
either
gravitydefying
gymnastics
or
soft
coos[134]
while
allmusic
editor
stephen
thomas
erlewine
expressed
similar
sentiments
and
wrote
what
is
a
greater
problem
is
that
mariah's
voice
is
shot
sounding
in
tatters
throughout
the
record
she
can
no
longer
coo
or
softly
croon
nor
can
she
perform
her
trademark
gravitydefying
vocal
runs[135]
in
an
attempt
to
relaunch
her
career
following
the
poor
reception
to
glitter
as
well
as
her
breakdown
carey
announced
a

lasting
over

the

throughout

the

were
done
in

something
more

it's
much
more
intimate

feel
like

however
while
smaller

were
booked
throughout

and
featured
carey's
longtime

randy
jackson
as
the

musical
director[161][162]
carey's
performances
consisted
of
old
songs
from
her
catalog
as
well
as
her
newest
singles[163]
the
tour
received
warm
critical
reaction
from
music
critics
and
concert
goers
many
of
which
celebrated
the
quality
of
carey's
live
vocals
as
well
as
the
show
as
a
whole[164][165]
however
critics
felt
the
show's
excesses
such
as
carey's
often
costume
changes
and
prefilmed
clips
were
unnecessary
distractions[164]
the
tour
proved
successful
with

fans
in

engagement

was
scheduled
to
take

shows[167]
the
shows
were
cancelled
however
after
tickets
went
on
sale
according
to
carey's
thenmanager
benny
medina
the
cancellation
was
due
to
the
concert
promoter's
refusal
to
pay
carey
her
agreedupon
compensation[167]
the
promoter
instead
blamed
poor
ticket
sales
(allegedly
only
4000
tickets
had
sold)
and
carey's
outrageous
demands[168]
carey
ultimately
sued
the
promoter
claiming
$1&nbspmillion
in
damages

although
e=mc&sup2
was
well
received
by
most
critics[172]
some
of
them
criticized
it
for
being
very
similar

i
have

on

my

says
i've
had
them
since
i
was

that's
why
i
have
the
high

the

and
i
can
still
be

a
lot
of
people
couldn't
sing
through
the
nodules
the
way
i
do
i've
learned
to
sing
through
my
vocal
cords
the
only
thing
that
really
affects
my
voice
is
sleep
sometimes
if
i'm
exhausted
i
can't
hit
the
really
high
notes
my
doctors
showed
me
my
vocal
cords
and
why
i
can
hit
those
high
notes
it's
a
certain
part
of
the
cord
that
not
many
people
use—the
very
top
my
natural
voice
is
low
i
have
a
raspy
voice
i'm
really
more
of
an
alto
but
my
airy
voice
can
be
high
if
i'm
rested
[]
when
i
was
little
i'd
talk
in
this
really
high
whisper
and
my
mom
would
be
like
'you're
being
ridiculous'
i
thought
if
i
can
talk
like
that
i
can
sing
like
that
so
i
started
[she
goes
higher

higher

just
messing
around
with
it
i'd
practice
and
practice
and
she'd
be
like
you're
gonna
hurt
yourself
i'd
tell
her
it
doesn't
hurt
if
i
were
to
try

type
carey
said
that
she
is
an
alto
though
several
critics
have
described
her
as
a
soprano[263][264]
however
within
contemporary
forms
of
music
singers
are
classified
by
the
style
of
music
they
sing
there
is
currently
no
authoritative
voice
classification
system
within
nonclassical
music[265]
attempts
have
been
made
to
adopt
classical
voice
type
terms
to
other
forms
of
singing
but
they
are
controversial[265]
because
the
development
of
classic
voice
categorizations
were
made
with
the
understanding
that
the
singer
would
amplify
his
or
her
voice
with
their
natural
resonators
without
a
microphone[266]
jon
pareles
of
the
new
york
times
describes
carey's
lower
register
as
a
rich
husky
alto
that
extends
to
dogwhistle
high
notes[267]
carey
also
possesses
a
whisper
register

it
this

register[268]
additionally
towards
the
late
1990s
carey
began
incorporating
breathy
vocals
into
her
material
usually
beginning
the
song
and
then
building
up
to
a
full
throated
climax[269]

had
on

in

as
an

he

have
introduced
melisma
(the
vocally
acrobatic
style
of
lending
a
word
an
extra
syllable
or
twenty)
to
the
charts
but
it
was
mariah—with

range—who
made
it
into

sound[279]

also
added
that
every
time
you
turn

you
are
watching

children[279]
despite
her
vocal
prowess
carey's
vocal
technique
particularly
with
the
use
of
melisma
and
belting
has
been
subject
to
public
scrutiny
mainly
because
of
young
singers
such
as
from

have
been
overly
imitating
her
singing
technique
in
which
critics
commented
mariah
carey
is
without

the
worst
thing
to
happen
to
amateur
singing
since

noted
in

the

carey's
influence
not
just
stops
in
the
emulation
of
melisma
or
her
singing
amongst
the
wannabe's
it's
also
her
persona
her

her
stardom
which

carey
is
also
credited
for
introducing
rb
and
hip
hop
into
mainstream
pop
culture
and
for
popularizing
rap
as
a
featuring
act
through
her
post1995
songs[61]
sasha
frerejones
editor
of
the
new
yorker
commented
it
became
standard
for
rb/hiphop
stars
like
missy
elliott
and
beyonc&eacute
to
combine
melodies
with
rapped
verses
and
young
white
pop
stars—including
britney
spears
jessica
simpson
christina
aguilera
and
'n
sync—have
spent
much
of
the
past
ten
years
making
pop
music
that
is
unmistakably
rb[61]
moreover
jones
concludes
that
[carey's]
idea
of
pairing
a
female
songbird
with
the
leading
male
mcs
of
hiphop
changed
rb
and
eventually
all
of
pop
although
now
anyone
is
free
to
use
this
idea
the
success
of
the
emancipation
of
mimi
suggests
that
it
still
belongs
to
carey[61]
judnick
mayard
writer
of

wrote
that
in

of
rb
and
hip
hop

the
champion
of
this
movement
is

carey[294]
mayard
also
expressed
that
to
this
day
odb
and
mariah
may
still
be
the
best
and
most
random
hip
hop
collaboration
of
all
time
citing
that
due
to
the
record
fantasy
rb
and
hip
hop
were
the
best
of

siblings[294]

wrote
in

ms
carey
pioneered
a
subgenre
that
some
people
call
the

duet
nowadays
cleancut
pop

teamed
up
with
