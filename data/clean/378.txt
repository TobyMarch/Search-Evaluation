watership
down
has
been
a
staple
of
highschool
english
classes
for
years
despite
the
fact
that
it's
often
a
hard
sell
at
first
(what
teenager
wouldn't
cringe
at
the
thought
of
400plus
pages
of
talking
rabbits?)
richard
adams's
bunnycentric
epic
rarely
fails
to
win
the
love
and
respect
of
anyone
who
reads
it
regardless
of
age
like
most
great
novels
watership
down
is
a
rich
story
that
can
be
read
(and
reread)
on
many
different
levels
the
book
is
often
praised
as
an
allegory
with
its
analogs
between
human
and
rabbit
culture
(a
fact
sometimes
used
to
goad
skeptical
teens
who
resent
the
challenge
that
they
won't
get
it
into
reading
it)
but
it's
equally
praiseworthy
as
just
a
corking
good
adventure
the
story
follows
a
warren
of
berkshire
rabbits
fleeing
the
destruction
of
their
home
by
a
land
developer
as
they
search
for
a
safe
haven
skirting
danger
at
every
turn
we
become
acquainted
with
the
band
and
its
compelling
culture
and
mythos
adams
has
crafted
a
touching
involving
world
in
the
dirt
and
scrub
of
the
english
countryside
complete
with
its
own
folk
history
and
language
(the
book
comes
with
a
lapine
glossary
a
guide
to
rabbitese)
as
much
about
freedom
ethics
and
human
nature
as
it
is
about
a
bunch
of
bunnies
looking
for
a
warm
hideyhole
and
some
mates
watership
down
will
continue
to
make
the
transition
from
classroom
desk
to
bedside
table
for
many
generations
to
come

watership
down
was
richard
adams'
debut
novel
and
was
first
published
in
1972
he
originally
told
it
to
his
children
to
help
pass
the
time
on
long
car
journeys
it
won
the
guardian
award
and
the
carnegie
medal
in
1973
and
is
set
in
berkshire
where
adams
was
born
in
1920
it
is
of
course
about
rabbits
and
was
made
into
an
animated
film
in
1978

the
soundtrack
of
which
featured
bright
eyes
by
art
garfunkel
the
book
opens
at
sandleford
warren
in
may
with
hazel
a
yearling
and
his
brother
fiver
feeding
at
sunset
although
brothers
the
pair
are
very
different
fiver
was
the
runt
of
the
litter
and
as
a
result
is
a
lot
smaller
and
much
more
nervous
than
his
brother
he
is
however
also
something
of
a
seer
and

not
long
after
the
book
opens

foresees
the
destruction
of
their
home
warren
the
pair
bring
the
prophecy
to
the
threarah
their
chief
rabbit

who
despite
fiver's
success
rate
refuses
to
accept
it
the
brothers
decide
to
leave
anyhow
and
mean
to
bring
whoever
wishes
to
come
along
with
them
a
number
of
others
join
them
including
two
owsla
members

silver
a
nephew
of
the
threarah
and
bigwig
although
they
have
little
idea
of
where
they're
going
fiver
knows
what
they
should
be
looking
for
and
have
an
excellent
leader
in
hazel
this
book
has
so
much
going
for
it
it's
hard
to
write
a
review
that
will
do
it
justice
bigwig
was
a
great
character

an
allaction
rabbit
(yes
really
!!)
whose
name
comes
from
the
strange
tuft
of
hair
between
his
ears
however
he's
not
the
only
star
other
notable
characters
include
general
woundwort
the
leader
of
another
warren
and
the
baddest
rabbit
in
england
(a
vicious
character
he'd
leave
your
average
bunnyboiler
with
badly
burnt
fingers
and
causes
our
heroes
a
great
deal
of
trouble)
kehaar
a
somewhat
foulmouthed
(or
is
that
foulbeaked
?)
seagull
provides
a
certain
amount
of
humour
he
also
helps
the
rabbits
establish
themselves
after
they
arrive
at
their
new
home
the
story
is
very
engaging
and
is
very
well
told
adams
explains
the
way
rabbit
society
is
structured
for
example
including
the
role
of
a
chief
rabbit
and
his
owsla
as
the
story
progresses
he
includes
a
few
words
of
the
rabbits'
own
language
and
a
few
of
their
myths

these
are
very
much
centred
on
the
great
rabbit
hero
elahrairah
an
excellent
book
and
highly
recommended

watership

is
a
good
book
for

it
is
more
than
a

are
a

only
the
british
seem
to
know
how
to
write
for
children
without
talking
down
to
them
while
telling
a
gripping
adventure
about
a
group
of
rabbits
adams
also
makes
a
strong
statement
about
the
nature
of
leadership
contrasting
the
intelligent
and
intuitive
protagonist
hazel
with
the
repressive
and
authoritarian
general
woundwort
the
book's
environmental
message
is
also
as
relevant
