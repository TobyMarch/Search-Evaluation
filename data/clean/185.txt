singer
robert

bassist/keyboardist
john

and
drummer
john

they
are
widely
considered
to
be
one
of
the
most
successful
innovative
and
influential
rock
groups
in
history
after
changing
their
name
they
signed
a
favourable
deal
with
atlantic
records
that
allowed
them
considerable
artistic
freedom
led
zeppelin
disliked
releasing
their
songs
as
singles
they
viewed
their
albums
as
indivisible
and
complete
listening
experiences
due
to
the
heavy
guitardriven
blues
rock
sound
of
their
first
two
albums
led
zeppelin
are
frequently
recognised
as
the
progenitors
of
heavy
metal
and
hard
rock
however
the
band's
individualistic
style
drew
from
a
wide
variety
of
influences
including
folk
music
which
they
incorporated
into
their
next
two
albums
their
untitled
fourth
album
which
features
the
track
stairway
to
heaven
is
among
the
most
popular
and
influential
works
in
rock
music
and
it
cemented
the
status
of
the
group
as
superstars
subsequent
albums
saw
greater
experimentation
and
were
accompanied
by
recordbreaking
tours
which
earned
them
a
reputation
for
excess
although
they
remained
commercially
and
critically
successful
in
the
later
1970s
the
band's
output
and
touring
schedule
were
limited
by
the
personal
difficulties
and

days

costs[21]
after

completion
the
band
were
forced
to
change
their
name
after

the
supergroup
with

and
beck
would
go
down
like
a
lead
balloon

british
idiom
for
disastrous
results[23]
the
group
dropped
the
'a'
in
lead
at
the
suggestion
of
their
manager
peter
grant
so
that
those
unfamiliar
with
the
phrase
would
not
pronounce
it
leed[24]
the
word
balloon
was
transformed
into
zeppelin
perhaps
an
exaggeration
of
the
humour
and
to

the
name
conjured
the
perfect
combination
of
heavy
and
light
combustibility
and
grace[23]

deal
of
$200000
from

the

say
over
the
contents

selling

helping

cement

the
group
also
increasingly
shunned

appearances
enforcing
their
preference
that

hear
and
see
them
in
live
concerts[40][41]

completed
several
more

tours

played
initially
in

ballrooms
then
in
larger
auditoriums
as
their
popularity
grew[14]
some
early
led

concerts
lasted
more
than
four
hours
with
expanded
and
improvised
live
versions
of
their
song
repertoire
many
of
these
shows
have
been
preserved
as

bootleg

it
was
during
this
period
of
intensive
concert
touring
that
the
band
developed
a
reputation
for
offstage
excess[42]
one
alleged
example
of
such
extravagance
was
the
shark
episode

red
snapper
incident
which
is
said
to
have
taken
place
at

strongly
influenced

the
album's
rich

sound
initially
received
mixed
reactions
with
critics
and
fans
surprised
at
the
turn
from
the
primarily
electric
arrangements
of
the

fuelling
further

to

banned
from

developed
a
reputation
for
trashing

out

some
suggest
that
these
tales
have
been
exaggerated

journalist

argues
that
[led

travels
spawned
many
stories
but
it
was
a
myth
that

were
constantly
engaged
in
acts
of
wanton

behaviour[52]

released
on

there
was
no

to
avoid

pigeonholing
by

the

looked

considering

musical

john
bonham
on
stage
in
the
us
around
1975
whose
aggressive
drumming
style
was
critical
to
the
hard
rock
sound
associated
with
the
band
led
zeppelin's
music
was
rooted
in
the
blues[14]
the
influence
of
abrupt
nonfluid
american
blues
of
howlin'
wolf
muddy
waters
and
skip
james
was
particularly
apparent
especially
on
led
zeppelin
i
and
ii[126]
tracks
were
structured
around
the
twelvebar
blues
on
every
studio
album
except
one
and
the
blues
directly
and
indirectly
influenced
other
songs
both
musically
and
lyrically[127]
the
band
were
also
strongly
influenced
by
the
music
of
the
british
celtic
and
american
folk
revivals[14]
scottish
folk
guitarist
bert
jansch
helped
inspire
page
and
from
him
he
adapted
open
tunings
and
aggressive
strokes
into
his
playing[29]
the
band
also
drew
on
a
wide
variety
of
genres
including
world
music[14]
and
elements
of
early
rock
and
roll
jazz
country
funk
soul
and
reggae
particularly
on
houses
of
the
holy
and
the
albums
that
followed[126]
the
material
on
the
first
two
albums
was
largely
constructed
out
of
extended
jams
of
blues
standards[14]
and
folk
songs[128][129]
this
method
led
to
the
mixing
of
musical
and
lyrical
elements
of
different
songs
and
versions
as
well
as
improvised
passages
to
create
new
material
but
would
lead
to
later
accusations
of
plagiarism
and
some
legal
disputes
over
copyright[128]
usually
the
music
was
developed
first
sometimes
with
improvised
lyrics
that
might
then
be
rewritten
for
the
final
version
of
the
song[129]
from
the
visit
to
bronyuraur
in
1970
the
songwriting
partnership
between
page
and
plant
became
predominant
with
page
supplying
the
music
largely
via
his
acoustic
guitar
and
plant
emerging
as
the
band's
chief
lyricist
jones
and
bonham
then
added
to
the
material
in
rehearsal
or
in
the
studio
as
a
song
was
developed[130]
in
the
later
stages
of
the
band's
career
page
took
a
back
seat
in
composition
and
jones
became
increasingly
important
in
producing
music
often
composed
on
the
keyboard
plant
would
then
add
lyrics
before
page
and
bonham
developed
their
parts[131][132]
page

the
doublenecked

used
for
playing
the
light
and
shade
of
stairway
to
heaven
live
early
lyrics
drew
on
the
band's
blues
and
folk
roots
often
mixing
lyrical
fragments
from
different
songs[133]
many
of
the
band's
songs
dealt
with
themes
of
romance
unrequited
love
and
sexual
conquest
which
were
common
in
rock
pop
and
blues
music[134]
some
of
their
lyrics
especially
those
derived
from
the
blues
have
been
interpreted
as
misogynistic[134]
particularly
from
led
zeppelin
iii
they
incorporated
elements
of
mythology
and
mysticism
into
their
music[14]
which
largely
grew
out
of
plant's
interest
in
legends
and
history[135]
these
elements
were
often
taken
to
reflect
page's
interest
in
the
occult
which
resulted
in
accusations
that
the
recordings
contained
subliminal
satanic
messages
some
of
which
were
said
to
be
contained
in
backmasking
claims
generally
dismissed
by
the
band
and
music
critics[136]
susan
fast
argues
that
as
plant
emerged
as
the
band's
main
lyricist
the
songs
more
obviously
reflected
his
alignment
with
the
west
coast
counterculture
of
the
1960s[137]
in
the
later
part
of
the
band's
career
plant's
lyrics
became
more
autobiographical
and
less
optimistic
drawing
on
his
own
experiences
and
circumstances[138]
according
to
robert
walser
led
zeppelin's
sound
was
marked
by
speed
and
power
unusual
rhythmic
patterns
contrasting
terraced
dynamics
singer
robert
plant's
wailing
vocals
and
guitarist
jimmy
page's
heavily
distorted
crunch[139]
these
elements
mean
that
they
are
often
cited
as
one
of
the
progenitors
of
hard
rock[140]
and
heavy
metal[139][6]
and
they
have
been
described
as
the
definitive
heavy
metal
band[14]
although
they
have
often
eschewed
the
label[141]
part
of
this
reputation
depends
on
the
bands
use
of
distorted
guitar
riffs
on
songs
like
whole
lotta
love
and
the
wanton
song[12][142]
often
riffs
were
not
doubled
by
guitar
bass
and
drums
exactly
but
instead
there
were
melodic
or
rhythmic
variations[143]
as
in
black
dog
where
three
different
time
signatures
are
used[144]
page's
guitar
playing
incorporated
elements
of
the
blues
scale
with
those
of
eastern
music[145]
plant's
use
of
highpitched
shrieks
has
been
compared
to
janis
joplin's
vocal
technique[12][146]
bonham's
drumming
was
noted
for
its
power
his
rapid
rolls
and
his
fast
beats
on
a
single
bass
drum[147]
jones'
basslines
have
been
described
as
melodic[148]
and
his
keyboard
playing
added
a
classical
touch
to
the
band's
sound[12]
page
stated
that
he
wanted
led
zeppelin
to
produce
music
that
had
light
and
shade
this
began
to
be
more
clearly
realised
from
led
zeppelin
iii
which
made
greater
use
of
acoustic
instruments[14]
this
approach
has
been
seen
as
exemplified
in
the
fourth
album
particularly
on
stairway
to
heaven
which
begins
with
acoustic
guitar
and
recorder
and
ends
with
drums
and
heavy
electric
sounds[144][149]
towards
the
end
of
their
recording
career
they
moved
to
a
more
mellow
and
progressive
sound
dominated
by
jones'
keyboard
motifs[150]
they
also
increasingly
made
use
of
various
layering
and
production
techniques
including
multitracking
and
overdubbed
guitar
parts[126]
their
emphasis
on
the
sense
of
dynamics
and
ensemble
arrangement[126]
has
been
seen
as
producing
an
individualistic
style
that
transcends
any
single
music
genre[151][152]
ian
peddie
argues
that
they
were
&nbsploud
powerful
and
often
heavy
but
their
music
was
also
humorous
selfreflective
and
extremely
subtle[153]

one

in

music
despite
everything
they
had

as
well
as

they

some
early
punk
and
postpunk
bands
among
them
the
ramones[163]
and
the
cult[164][165]
they
were
also
an
important
influence
on
the
development
of
alternative
rock
as
bands
adapted
elements
from
the
zeppelin
sound
of
the
mid1970s[166][167]
including
the
smashing
pumpkins[168][169]
nirvana[170]

that
in

next

they're
the
most

they
influence
the
way

is

aor

they
set
the
standards
for
the
aorradio
format
with
'stairway

having

necessarily
having

hits
they're
the
ones
who
did
the

consistently
selling

jim

argues
that
on
one
level
led
zeppelin
represents
the
final
flowering
of
the
sixties'
psychedelic
ethic
which
casts
rock
as
passive
sensory
involvement[184]
led
zeppelin
have
also
been
described
as
the
quintessential
purveyors[185]
of
masculine
and
aggressive
cock
rock

this
assertion

been
challenged[186]

the
