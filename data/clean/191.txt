february

yeo
formatpaperback
i
own
several
led
zep
books
so
it
was
nice
to
get
my
hands
on
this
one
by
dave
lewis

one
of
the
band's
keepers
the
good
news
for
zepphiles
is
that
there
is
new
information
this
book
makes
a
good
complement
to
luis
rey's
zep
concert
book
(now
outofprint
i
believe)
it
doesn't
try
to
be
academic
but
rather
anecdotal

so
that
we
get
a
much
better
picture
of
the
actual
live
environment
that
zep
lived
in
at
the
time
it
includes
reviews
from
various
news
sources
and
ontheground
accounts
of
what
happened
here
and
there
would
have
been
nice
if
the
book
was
a
little
longer
but
it
aims
to
be
concise
rather
than
overwritten
lewis
also
tries
to
be
as
balanced
as
he
can
be
sure
there's
room
to
disagree
on
this
and
that
but
this
is
a
good
if
not
essential
companion
for
zep
collectors
keen
on
learning
more
on
the
band's
live
legacy

january

by
brewhockey
formatpaperback
this
book
is
written
as
a
series
of
concert
reviews
but
it
is
much
more
the
author
describes
events
leading
up
to
the
concerts
and
in
some
cases
explains
why
certain
concerts
were
more
important
to
the
band's
development
than
others
i
find
the
ability
to
follow
a
particular
song's
progress
from
introduction
to
regular
part
of
the
band's
set
one
of
the
most
interesting
aspects
of
this
book
if
you
are
interested
in
the
evolution
of
led
zeppelin's
live
set
you
will
likely
enjoy
this
book
if
you're
looking
for
a
band
biography
you'll
probably
be
happier
