adaption

bestselling
mystery
novel

directed
by

the
film
changes
certain
characters'
names
and
adheres
to
the
ending
of
the
play
rather
than
that
of
the

though
its
subject

is
dark
the
screenplay
injects
considerable
humor
into
the
proceedings
lightening
the

stranded

the
film
could
arguably
be
seen
as
a
precursor
to
the
modern
slasher
film
though
it
certainly
isn't
gory
and
the
deaths
are
not
played
up
for
their
horror
as
they
are
in
slasher
films
today
the
film
won
the
golden

plot
the
film
begins
with
ten
strangers
being
summoned
to
indian
island
a
small
island
off
the
coast
of
devon
by
a
mysterious
note
once
there
they
discover
that
their
unknown
host
a
certain
mr
owen
has
not
arrived
yet
though
this
fact
is
somewhat
odd
they
are
told
that
mr
owen
plans
on
arriving
for
dinner
and
so
they
all
retire
to
their
rooms
to
prepare
for
the
evening
when
they
all
sit
down
to
dinner
mr
owen
still
has
not
arrived
so
they
eat
their
meal
and
then
relax
in
the
living
room
suddenly
a
voice
on
a
gramophone
record
proceeds
to
accuse
all
of
them
of
past
murders
that
the
law
was
unable
to
prosecute
them
for
the
guests
vehemently
deny
any
wrongdoing
and
the
decision
is
made
to
leave
the
island
immediately
rogers
however
tells
them
that
there
is
no
way
to
get
the
boat
from
the
mainland
there
is
no
phone
on
the
island
and
the
boat
only
comes
twice
a
week
it
will
not
be
back
until
monday
morning
while
it
is
now
only
friday
night
at
this
point
starloff
confesses
that
the
accusations
against
him
are
true
his
only
punishment
was
to
have
his
driving
license
revoked
soon
thereafter
he
takes
a
drink
of
whiskey
and
chokes
to
death
though
dr
armstrong
confirms
that
there
was
poison
in
starloff's
glass
he
is
unable
to
ascertain
whether
his
death
was
murder
or
suicide
at
the
same
time
rogers
also
discovers
that
one
of
ten
little
indian
figurines
on
the
dinner
table
has
broken
the
next
morning
the
guests
arise
and
prepare
for
breakfast
only
to
be
greeted
with
ominous
news
mrs
rogers
has
died
in
her
sleep
victim
of
an
apparent
overdose
of
sedative
(she
became
extremely
upset
due
to
the
accusations
of
the
night
before)
another
figurine
is
also
missing
with
two
deaths
in
twelve
hours
the
remaining
guests
decide
to
form
a
search
party
and
canvass
the
island
as
they
believe
that
mr
owen
whoever
he
might
be
is
hiding
somewhere
but
a
search
of
both
the
house
and
the
outside
area
proves
fruitless
as
no
one
is
found
they
come
back
to
the
house
for
lunch
only
to
discover
the
body
of
gen
mandrake
a
knife
protruding
from
his
back
this
time
the
evidence
is
conclusive
mr
owen
has
invited
them
here
to
exact
punishment
for
their
past
crimesbut
there
is
no
one
else
on
the
island
it
is
the
judge
who
arrives
at
the
answer
since
there
truly
is
no
one
else
among
them
there
is
only
one
explanation
mr
owen
is
one
of
them
their
suspicions
now
aroused
the
guests
take
care
to
remain
in
sight
of
each
other
at
all
times
quincannon
decides
to
hold
a
secret
vote
whereby
everyone
writes
down
their
suspect
and
puts
it
into
a
hat
rogers
receives
two
votes
more
than
anyone
else
the
guests
decide
that
they
would
feel
safer
with
him
not
sleeping
in
the
house
so
rogers
spends
the
night
in
the
washhouse
the
guests
ask
him
to
keep
the
key
to
the
dining
room
which
contains
the
indian
figurines
as
they
intend
to
lock
him
out
of
the
house
and
that
way
mr
owen
will
not
have
access
to
the
figures
in
any
possible
way
(if
rogers
is
the
killer
he
will
not
be
able
to
get
into
the
house
and
if
he
is
innocent
the
real
culprit
will
not
have
access
either)
but
when
they
wake
up
the
next
morning
they
find
rogers
dead
his
head
split
open
with
an
axe
and
another
little
figure
missing
they
are
suspicious
of
miss
brent
who
claims
to
have
been
out
for
a
walk
by
the
ocean
that
morning
as
vera
prepares
breakfast
in
the
kitchen
miss
brent
advises
her
to
be
cautious
of
lombard
who
has
taken
a
bit
of
an
interest
in
her
alone
with
vera
miss
brent
tells
her
version
of
the
story
regarding
the
gramophone's
accusation
she
says
that
her
young
nephew
had
been
quite
rebellious
and
since
whipping
did
no
good
she
had
him
placed
in
a
reformatory
he
then
hanged
himself
later
that
day
miss
brent's
lifeless
body
is
found
in
her
room
dead
of
a
lethal
injection
dr
armstrong
searches
his
medical
kit
and
discovers
his
hypodermic
needle
missing
apparently
the
same
one
used
to
kill
miss
brent
it
is
also
established
that
lombard
carried
a
revolver
to
the
island
with
him
but
it
is
now
missing
as
well
with
only
five
guests
remaining
tensions
are
running
high
when
the
lights
begin
to
flicker
blore
goes
to
check
the
generator
accidentally
causing
it
to
short
circuit
and
the
house
is
plunged
into
darkness
quincannon
advises
armstrong
that
this
was
probably
a
ploy
by
the
killer
but
since
he
and
armstrong
have
been
together
the
entire
time
this
means
that
they
can
trust
one
another
as
everyone
sits
down
to
dinner
that
night
armstrong
and
quincannon
tell
the
others
that
they
believe
the
best
chance
of
surviving
mr
owen's
trap
is
to
confess
the
truth
quincannon
reveals
that
the
accusation
against
him
is
true
he
sentenced
edward
seton
who
was
innocent
to
death
in
order
to
ruin
the
reputation
of
his
defending
council
armstrong
also
admits
to
the
death
of
his
patient
due
to
being
drunk
though
hesitant
at
first
blore
also
confesses
to
perjuring
his
testimony
against
an
innocent
man
lombard
likewise
states
that
the
record's
accusation
was
true
but
when
it
comes
time
for
vera
to
tell
her
story
she
says
that
she
is
cold
and
goes
to
her
room
to
get
a
coat
while
the
others
wait
for
her
in
the
dining
room
after
a
few
moments
they
hear
her
terrified
shriek
and
rush
out
of
the
room
in
the
confusion
of
the
moment
a
single
gunshot
is
heard
they
find
vera
cowering
in
a
corner
of
the
hallway
and
she
tells
them
that
when
she
went
into
her
room
she
felt
something
like
a
cold
hand
blore
goes
to
investigate
and
finds
a
piece
of
seaweed
that
miss
brent
had
brought
back
to
the
house
earlier
hanging
from
the
ceiling
of
miss
claythorne's
room
they
then
realize
that
quincannon
is
not
among
them
blore
believes
that
the
judge
fired
the
shot
at
one
of
them
in
the
dark
they
make
their
way
downstairs
and
discover
lombard's
gun
on
the
staircase
they
make
their
way
back
to
the
dining
room
and
find
quincannon
dead
from
a
gunshot
to
the
head
after
depositing
quincannon's
body
in
his
room
dr
armstrong
asks
vera
for
the
truth
about
her
sister's
fiance
though
reluctant
she
insists
that
she
is
innocent
of
the
accusation
and
goes
to
her
room
armstrong
tells
blore
and
lombard
that
to
his
mind
this
indicates
vera
is
quite
likely
to
be
mr
owen
armstrong
says
that
prior
to
his
death
quincannon
advised
him
that
only
the
person
who
had
not
committed
a
crime
would
be
interested
in
meting
out
justice
blore
seems
to
accept
this
explanation
but
lombard
is
highly
skeptical
they
all
retire
to
their
rooms
later
that
night
vera
wakes
up
to
find
lombard
standing
outside
her
patio
wanting
to
be
let
in
she
admits
him
only
after
he
lets
her
take
his
gun
for
protection
philip
says
that
he
wants
to
be
with
vera
when
the
real
mr
owen
comes
into
the
room
which
he
suspects
will
be
very
soon
in
the
meantime
he
asks
her
again
about
the
accusation
against
her
and
vera
repeats
that
she
is
innocent
of
the
crime
she
explains
to
him
that
it
was
her
sister
who
killed
the
man
and
she
helped
conceal
the
murder
and
took
care
of
her
sister
until
she
died
they
then
hear
someone
walking
around
outside
the
room
and
philip
goes
to
investigate
before
leaving
however
he
reveals
that
he
is
not
really
philip
lombard
vera
and
philip
go
to
blore's
room
and
find
him
there
but
armstrong
is
missing
from
his
room
when
the
three
of
them
go
to
the
dining
room
they
discover
another
missing
figure
but
they
believe
that
armstrong
is
trying
to
make
them
believe
he
is
dead
the
next
morning
blore
is
checking
around
the
house
with
binoculars
as
they
all
wait
for
the
boat
to
arrive
he
is
murdered
when
a
large
stone
structure
falls
on
him
lombard
and
vera
find
his
body
and
philip
takes
the
binoculars
and
sees
what
the
detective
was
looking
at
he
and
vera
make
their
way
to
the
island's
beach
and
find
armstrong's
corpse
lombard
states
that
he
has
been
dead
for
hours
as
there
are
no
footprints
around
the
body
as
they
are
the
only
two
left
vera
believes
that
lombard
is
the
murderer
lombard
however
cannot
bring
himself
to
believe
that
vera
is
a
killer
he
tells
her
that
his
real
name
is
charles
morley
and
that
he
knew
philip
lombard
very
well
he
found
mr
owen's
invitation
and
came
to
the
island
impersonating
lombard
to
see
if
the
invitation
had
anything
to
do
with
his
friend's
death
charles
tells
her
to
aim
the
gun
away
from
him
and
pull
the
trigger
when
he
falls
she
is
to
go
to
the
mansion
she
does
so
he
collapses
and
she
makes
her
way
back
to
the
house
once
inside
she
is
confronted
with
the
true
culprit
judge
quincannon
quincannon
tells
her
that
all
his
life
he
searched
for
perfect
human
justice
and
this
weekend
was
his
way
to
bring
it
about
after
learning
that
he
was
terminally
ill
he
concocted
this
plan
as
part
of
his
scheme
he
deceived
armstrong
into
thinking
that
the
two
of
them
could
discover
who
the
murderer
was
together
they
faked
the
judge's
death
but
it
wasn't
until
the
last
minute
that
armstrong
realized
he
had
been
made
a
fool
of
and
quincannon
killed
him
quincannon
drinks
a
glass
of
poisoned
whiskey
and
tells
vera
that
she
has
two
options
she
can
commit
suicide
by
hanging
herself
here
privately
or
wait
to
be
convicted
at
trial
(as
the
murders
will
undoubtedly
be
blamed
on
her
as
she
is
the
last
person
alive)
and
be
hanged
publicly
right
before
he
dies
however
charles
appears
behind
vera
and
quincannon
realizes
that
two
will
survive
and
will
be
able
to
tell
what
actually
happened
on
indian
island
at
that
moment
the
boatman
arrives
to
take
them
back
to
the
mainland
the
nonsense
poem
ten
little
indians
is
recited
and
sung
throughout
the
film
and
each
death
in
the
film
corresponds
in

of

screenplay
differences
from
the
novel
this
adaptation
of
the
novel
took
overall
fewer
liberties
with
christie's
plot
than
some
of
the
other
versions
most
of
changes
were
made
in
order
to
comply
with
the
strict
hays
code
which
included
changing
the
backstories
behind
miss
brent's
and
vera
claythorne's
crimes
since
a
film
that
would
imply
such
themes
as
child
murder
and
teenage
pregnancy
would
never
be
allowed
to
be
viewed
by
the
general
public
the
ending
though
is
radically
altered
only
the
1987
soviet
film
version
kept
the
novel's
ending
this
film
like
all
the
other
western
versions
changed
the
shooting
of
philip
lombard
(played
by
louis
hayward)
and
the
suicide
of
vera
claythorne's
character
(played
by
june
duprez)
in
favour
of
a
more
upbeat
ending
vera
only
pretends
to
shoot
lombard
so
that
the
real
murderer
will
believe
he
is
dead
in
this
the
film
follows
the
altered
denouement
christie
herself
had
rewritten
for
her
1943
stage
version
of
the
book
there
is
one
major
alteration
—
in
the
play
vera
thinks
she
has
shot
lombard
after
which
the
murderer
appears
and
attacks
her
lombard
who
was
only
grazed
comes
to
at
the
last
minute
and
shoots
the
murderer
as
he
is
about
to
strangle
the
terrified
girl
the
film
however
simply
has
vera
help
lombard
fake
his
death
outside
the
mansion
then
confront
the
culprit
who
commits
suicide
after
revealing
his
motive
and
murder
techniques
all
in
all
the
end
result
is
the
same
the
two
major
characters
are
left
alive
and
innocent
of
the
crimes
they
were
accused
of
later
remakes
in
1965
1974
and
1989
(all
using
the
title
ten
little
indians)
also
used
christie's
revised
finale
one
final
alteration
is
the
title
christie's
novel
was
originally
titled
ten
little
niggers
and
then
it
was
changed
to
ten
little
indians
the
title
it
is
primarily
known
by
today
along
with
joseph
conrad's
the
nigger
of
the
narcissus
the
title
stands
as
an
indicator
of
the
casual
acceptance
in
the
late
1890s
through
the
1930s
of
the
virulently
racist
