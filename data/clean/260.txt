gibb
onethird
of
the
bee
gees
died
sunday
after
a
long
battle
with
cancer
his
spokesperson
has
confirmed
via
a
statement&nbspgibb
was
62
years
old
the
family
of
robin
gibb
of
the
bee
gees
announce
with
great
sadness
that
robin
passed
away
today
following
his
long
battle
with
cancer
and
intestinal
surgery
reads
the
statement
the
family
have
asked
that
their
privacy
is
respected
at
this
very
difficult
time
two
years
ago
gibb
battled
colon
and
liver
cancer
but
despite
making
what
he
called
a
spectacular
recovery
a
secondary
tumor
recently
developed
complicated
by
a
case
of
pneumonia
in
april
the
singer
was
hospitalized
last
month
and
fell
into
a
coma
at
one
point
although
he
was
later
said
to
have
regained
consciousness
and
communicated
with
family
members&nbsp
gibb
was
born
in
the
isle
of
man
in
1949
along
with
twin
brother
maurice
(maurice
died
in
2003
of
complications
from
a
twisted
intestine
eerily
robin
had
surgery
for
the
same
medical
issue
in
2010)
along
with
their
older
brother
barry
the
brothers
began
harmonizing
as
a
trio
in
australia
where
the
family
moved
in
1958
although
the
bee
gees
had
some
success
in
australia
–
they
hosted
a
weekly
variety
show
there
–
they
didn't
truly
arrive
until
they
returned
to
england
and
signed
with
manager
robert
stigwood
robin's
quivering
vulnerable
voice
was
featured
prominently
on
several
of
the
group's
earliest
and
most
beatleseque
hits
including
new
york
mining
disaster
1941
i
started
a
joke
massachusetts
and
i've
gotta
get
a
message
to
you
although
he
looked
and
sounded
like
the
meekest
bee
gee
robin
grew
into
the
family
rebel
by
1969
he
and
barry
were
feuding
over
whose
song
should
be
singles
and
robin
then
20
was
declared
a
ward
of
the
state
by
their
father
when
his
drinking
and
partying
seemed
to
take
over
his
life
it
happened
so
fast
that
we
lost
communication
between
us
gibb
later
recalled
it
was
just
madness
really
but
it
was
also
robin
who
in
1971
made
the
first
call
to
barry
to
reunite
with
his
brothers
robin's
solo
career
had
stalled
and
barry
and
maurice's
attempts
to
continue
the
bee
gees
as
a
duo
had
floundered
as
well
if
we
hadn't
been
related
we
would
probably
have
never
gotten
back
together
robin
said
at
the
time
robin's
voice
was
heard
beautifully
on
the
chorus
of
their
minor
1972
hit
run
to
me&nbsp
the
bee
gees'
massive
second
wind
arrived
with
their
proto
disco
hit
jive
talkin'
in
1975
two
years
later
their
contributions
to
saturday
night
fever
made
them
bigger
stars
than
ever
most
of
the
hits
from
that
era
featured
barry's
falsetto
voice
but
the
brothers'
vocal
blend
remained
an
indelible
part
of
their
sound
the
group
entered
another
fallow
period
during
the
early
eighties
although
during
this
time
robin
produced
a
semihit
album
by
jimmy
ruffin
brother
of
the
temptations'
david
ruffin
the
last
bee
gees
album
this
is
where
i
came
in
was
released
in
2001
two
years
later
maurice
died
and
with
his
passing
the
bee
gees
ended
(their
other
younger
brother
andy
died
in
1988)
robin
and
barry
reunited
periodically
–
in
2010
they
made
an
appearance
on
american
idol
and
inducted
abba
into
the
rock
and
roll
hall
of
fame
–
and
talked
about
a
duo
tour
but
nothing
materialized
robin
though
kept
his
hand
in
music
with
his
son
robinjohn
he
wrote
an
ambitious
piece
the
titanic
requiem
a
mix
of
orchestral
and
vocal
pieces
telling
the
story
of
the
doomed
liner
on
the
100th
anniversary
of
its
sinking
it's
a
serious
subject
and
it's
not
a
rock
opera
gibb
said
before
its
debut
there
are
no
backbeats
this
could
have
been
written
300
years
ago
featuring
the
royal
philharmonic
orchestra
the
work
had
its
world
premiere
in
london
on
april
10th
but
in
a
sign
that
gibb's
health
had
taken
a
turn
for
the
worse
he
wasn't
able
to
attend&nbsp
