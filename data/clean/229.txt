ballads
primarily
cowritten

and
walter
afanasieff
with
whom
she
had
previously
worked
on
emotions
(1991)
and
a
few
urban
dance
tracks
during
the
course
of
the
album's
development
carey
wanted
to
broaden
her
audience
choosing
a
more
poporiented
sound
during
this
time
frame
they
experimented
with
different
organs
and
other
musical
instruments
leading
the
album's
sound
away
from
her
more
contemporary
previous
efforts
two
unused
tracks
from
the
album
sessions
were
released
as
bsides
do
you
think
of
me
and
everything
fades
away
in
order
to
successfully
take
the
album
in
a
new
direction
carey
and
afanasieff
sought
out
new
and
innovative
producers
as
well
as
some
from
carey's
previous
releases
kenneth
babyface
edmonds
first
began
working
with
carey
on
music
box
where
he
helped
produce
some
of
the
album's
softer
and
more
melodious
tracks
as
well
as
being
part
of
the
songwriting
process
additional
writers
and
producers
were
robert
clivill&eacutes
and
david
cole
(a
pair
also
known
as
c+c
music
factory)
and
daryl
simmons
while
the
album
featured
a
range
of
different
talented
music
producers
the
bulk
of
the
songwriting
was
done
by
carey
and
her
writing
partner
walter
afanasieff
in
future
projects
they
would
continue
writing
material
for
carey's
albums
until
her

mariah
and
dave
did
this
loop
thing
and
it
was
new
to
us
pop
producers
at
the
time
their
version
of
'dreamlover'
was
missing
a
lot
of
stuff
the
spirit
of
the
song
was
up
but
it
wasn't
hitting
hard
enough
[my
work
on
the
track]
put
a
whole
different
shade
of
colors
into
it
—afanasieff
on
dreamlover
before
and
after
he
worked
on
it[1]
in
1988
carey
was
discovered
by
tommy
mottola
ceo
of
columbia
records
and
was
promptly
signed
to
the
label
carey's
selftitled
debut
studio
album
released
the
following
year
focused
on
rerecording
and
mastering
several
songs
she
had
already
written
in
high
school
alongside
classmate
ben
margulies[2]
aside
from
the
seven
songs
taken
from
carey's
demo
tape
four
other
tracks
were
written
and
produced
by
the
former
and
an
array
of
famed
record
producers
the
album
was
complimented
by
critics
who
called
it
a
mature
debut
full
of
various
genre
influences
ranging
from
pop
rb
and
soul[3]
the
album
became
a
commercial
success
selling
over
fifteen
million
units
globally[4]
while
making
a
strong
impact
on
pop
music
carey
became
interested
in
altering
her
sound
and
deviating
from
pop
music
for
her
second
studio
effort
emotions
(1991)[3]
following
the
success
of
her
debut
columbia
allowed
her
to
take
more
control
over
her
musical
departure
enabling
her
to
change
her
genre
infusions
melodies
and
production
during
the
album's
recording
carey
worked
with
several
different
musicians
and
producers
aside
from
walter
afanasieff
the
only
hold
over
from
her
debut[5]
emotions
contained
influences
from
mostly
1950s
1960s
and
1970s
balladry
and
gospel
as
well
as
her
continued
work
of
rb
and
soul
the
album
while
praised
by
some
as
more
mature
and
raw
failed
to
reach
the
critical
or
commercial
heights
of
her
debut
effort
while
selling
far
less
and
failed
to
introduce
carey
into
a
different
market[6]
following
these
events
columbia
decided
to
try
to
market
carey
in
a
similar
fashion
to
her
debut
only
having
her
produce
a
more
commercial
and
radiofriendly
album
their
plans
were
to
tone
down
carey's
vocals
and
soften
the
album's
production
leaving
a
more
contemporary
pop/rb
record[7]
agreeing
to
the
change
carey
and
afanasieff
began
writing
and
recording
material
for
her
third
studio
effort
music
box
on
the
album's
first
track
dreamlover
carey
worked
with
dave
hall
throughout
the
song's
entire
production[1][8]
in
order
to
help
with
some
of
the
song's
arrangements
mottola
enrolled
the
help
of
walter
afanasieff
who
took
on
the
completed
track
and
transformed
it
into
a
more
commercial
hit[1]
writing
and
development
with
carey
in
the
captain's
chair
having
more
control
than
she
had
on
any
other
album
she
took
the
album
in
a
new
direction
alongside
afanasieff[1]
for
carey's
third
studio
effort
she
enrolled
the
help
of
a
range
of
songwriters
as
well
as
record
producers[1]
aside
from
afanasieff
kenneth
babyface
edmonds
a
man
who
would
collaborate
with
carey
often
in
the
near
future
also
took
part
in
the
project[1]
babyface
who
helped
produce
much
of
the
album
also
cowrote
a
track
with
carey
titled
never
forget
you
a
song
that
was
released
as
a
bside
to
without
you
exclusively
in
the
united
states[1]
the
album
which
consisted
mostly
of
slower
ballads
(with
the
exception
of
dreamlover
and
now
that
i
know)
contained
collaborations
with
some
carryon
producers
and
writers
from
emotions[1]
of
these
were
clivill&eacutes

cole
(of
c+c
music
factory)
who
cowrote
the
track
now
that
i
know
a
danceable
pop
ballad
which
used
similar
formulas
and
synthesizers
from
tracks
on
emotions
another
writer–producer
that
worked
on
the
album
was
david
hall
who
with
carey
wrote
the
us
single
dreamlover[1]
one
of
the
noticeable
differences
from
music
box
and
carey's
previous
albums
was
its
sound
the
album
was
described
by
afanasieff
as
a
softer
and
more
poporiented
album
filling
the
songs
with
air
and
allowing
far
more
space
in
the
overall
sound[1]
another
noticeable
change
was
in
the
album's
production[1]
when
mariah
carey
was
released
critics
took
notice
of
its
overly
produced
and
studio
perfect
quality
where
in
comparison
emotions
maintained
a
raw
live
sound[1]
music
box
however
fell
in
between
the
two
a
decision
made
by
carey
during
the
album's
production[1]
she
would
layer
each
track
with
live
backing
vocals
so
not
to
sound
too
overly
produced
but
still
kept

inclusion
of

the
final
single

the

critics
as

to

see
media
help
according
to
marc
shapiro
music
box
reflected
signs
of
carey's
vocal
maturity
as
well
as
representing
an
album
she
was
truly
proud
of[9]
the
album's
first
single
dreamlover
was
described
as
a
slight
piece
of
pop
fluff
representing
a
more
commercial
side
to
carey
than
the
more
ambitious
vision
of
love
critics
believed
the
song's
chart
performance
was
due
to
its
summer
release
as
people
were
still
looking
for
a
nottooheavy
and
more
diverse
sound[9]
the
song's
composition
was
described
as
mid
tempo
and
mildly
danceable
with
carey's
voice
being
called
perpetually
happy
like
a
littlegirl
voice
hero
the
album's
second
single
was
one
of
carey's
most
inspirational
ballads
at
the
time[1]
its
not
that
i'm
experimenting
with
lower
notes
i
actually
think
my
natural
voice
is
low
my
speaking
voice
is
low
you
know
what
i
mean?
and
i'm
really
comfortable
singing
in
my
lower
register
i
sing
from
the
heart
whatever
the
music
makes
me
feel
at
the
time
i
go
into
the
studio
to
sing
a
song
that's
what
it's
going
to
do
some
people
like
it
some
people
don't
but
it's
just
a
part
of
my
voice
and
that's
it
—carey
on
her
vocals
on
music
box
as
well
as
her
voice
in
general[10]
the
song
was
described
as
a
lush
ballad
with
carey
making
use
of
her
impressive
lower
alto
register[11]
as
one
of
the
more
emotional
tracks
on
the
album
hero
built
emotion
verse
through
verse
where
the
lyrics
and
melody
finally
broke
through[11]
anytime
you
need
a
friend
was
another
pop
ballad
in
which
carey
would
let
her
voice
roam
free
a
feature
critics
felt
lacked
on
the
album[11]
the
song
featured
rough
and
low
vocals
as
well
as
some
glimpses
of
carey's
upper
registers
as
with
most
of
the
songs
on
music
box
the
lyrics
boasted
a
positive
message
and
was
the
only
song
on
the
album
to
feature
traces
of
gospelinspired
vocals
throughout
the
chorus[11]
the
album's
title
track
music
box
was
another
ballad
carey
wrote
with
afanasieff[11]
the
song
was
described
as
one
of
carey's
more
difficult
compositions
due
to
its
softness
the
song
requires
a
great
deal
of
legato
to
keep
the
tunes
softness
and
sweetness
without
resorting
to
volume
carey's
vocals
on
the
track
are
defined
as
soft
and
controlled
managing
to
maintain
the
delicate
balance
in
a
manner
that
seems
effortless
floating
easily
over
the
keyboard
and
the
shimmer
of
the
guitar[11]
lyrically
due
to
the
song's
message
of
commitment
and
promise
and
the
tinkling
musicbox
line
played
on
the
synthesizer
the
track
gives
the
sensation
of
a
wedding
vow
recital[11]
never
forget
you
one
of
the
album's
bsides
is
a
slow
song
further
connecting
it
to
the
song's
message
of
lamenting
the
loss
of
love
in
a
very
tender
way
the
song
contains
lovely
keyboard
notes
that
hover
over
the
verses
and
allow
carey
to
indulge
in
her
backing
vocals[11]
it
was
described
as
a
stand
out
track
one
that
could
have
easily
become
a
hit
single
with
an
appeal
that
would
have
easily
transcended
generational
barriers[11]

upon

the
album

reviews
from
critics
with
positive
attention
given
to
its
lyrics
the
album's
energy
level
and
carey's
vocal
style
however
were
almost
unanimously
criticized
critics
felt
carey
became
too
mellow
and
somewhat
lazy
on
the
album
especially
in
comparison
to
her
previous
work
with
ron
wynn
writing
sometimes
excessive
spirit

to
an

bill
lamb
from
aboutcom
gave
the
album
a
generally
positive
review
calling
it
another
good
collection
of
dance
music
and
ballads
and
writing
that
the
songwriting
is
generally
high
quality
and
nilsson's
'without
you'
is
a
good
choice
for
a
cover[12]
on
a
more
critical
note
however
lamb
described
the
album
as
a
toned
down
album
and
that
carey's
upper
registers
aren't
accessed
as
often
as
in
previous
releases
writing
mariah
toned
down
the
vocal
gymnastics
here
but
she
seemed
to
lose
a
lot
of
her
energy
as
well
there
are
still
strong
songs
here
but
the
overall
effect
is
of
a
formula
wearing
a
bit
thin[12]
ron
wynn
from
allmusic
gave
the
album
4
out
of
5
stars
roc
wynn
of
allmusic
said
that
carey's
octaveleaping
voice
was
downplayed
in
favor
of
the
demonstration
of
her
ability
to
sing
softly
and
coolly[13]
although
favorably
stating
that
carey
lowered
the
volume
on
her
vocals
he
said
that
the
energy
had
declined
with
the
exception
of
personalityinjected
songs
like
hero
and
dreamlover
overall
however
he
claimed
the
album's
different
approach
was
wise[13]
ashley
s
battel
from
billboard
gave
the
album
a
positive
review
writing
while
carey
tones
down
the
predominance
of
her
tremendous
vocal
range
throughout
much
of
this
release
there
is
no
question
that
she
remains
the
driving
force
behind
yet
anoth[e]r
collection
of
heavyrotation
top40
successes[14]
david
browne
from
entertainment
weekly
gave
the
album
a
mixed
review[16]
he
said
that
due
to
carey's
lower
energy
level
her
voice
no
longer
soars
above
the
backup
chorus
instead
it
only
drip[s]
over
them
like
syrup
instead
of
overpowering
them
she
lets
the
melodies
speak
for
themselves[16]
browne
awarded
the
album
an
unenthusiastic
score
of
c+[16]
stephen
holden
of
rolling

complimented
carey's
vocals
but
found
her
lyrics
made
up
entirely
of
pop
and

clich&eacutes
and
stated
music
box
is
so
precisely
calculated
to
be
a
blockbuster
that
its
impact
is
ultimately
a
little
unnerving[18]
however
in
his
review
for
the
new
york
times
holden
wrote
that
the
album
takes
aim
at
the
commercial
pop
mainstream
with
an
even
sharper
focus
than
carey's
previous
albums
while
noting
if
huge

'hero'

carey
embarked
on
her

originally
carey
had
not
planned
to
tour
due
to
stage
fright
a
feat
she
followed
during
her
previous
album
releases[9]
however
after
the
continued
success
of
music
box
and
persuasion
from
tommy
mottola
carey
agreed
to
tour
supporting
her
current
and
previous
albums[9]
as
carey
was
not
physically
or
emotionally
ready
for
an
extensive
tour
six
shows
were
dated
each
with
many
days
in
between
in
order
to
give
carey's
voice
time
to
rest[9]
an
extra
performance
taking
place
at

was
planned
where
carey
would

were
selling
at
a
healthy
pace[9]
on
the
opening
night
of
carey's
tour
she
sang
at
the
miami
arena
the
show
was
only
about
twothirds
full
something
that
worried
carey's
management
as
it
was
the
tour's
opening
night
however
carey
did
not
seem
to
mind
and
began
the
show
with
high
spirits[9]
the
first
show
in
miami
received
scathing
reviews
with
critics
ripping
her
openingnight
performance
to
shreds
the
following
shows
were
more
favorable
to
carey
not
only
were
her
succeeding
shows
soldout
they
also
won
ravereviews[9]
regarding
carey's
show
in

the
new
york
times
wrote
the
following
remarks
regarding
carey's
voice
and
performance
on
the
tour
beyond
any
doubt
ms
carey's
voice
is
no
studio
concoction
her
range
extends
from
a
rich
husky
alto
to
dogwhistle
high
notes
she
can
linger
over
sensual
turns
growl
with
playful
confidence
syncopate
like
a
scat
singer
although
rock
concerts
aren't
known
for
precise
intonation
she
sang
with
startlingly
exact
pitch[50]
aside
from
touring
for
the
first
time
in
her
career
carey
visited
various
american
and
european
television
programs
where
she
performed
different
singles
from
the
album
in
late
1993
carey
appeared
on
the
arsenio
hall
show
where
she
performed
both
dreamlover
and
hero
other
performances
carey
staged
during
1993
included
hero
on
the
jay
leno
show
and
dreamlover
on
her
first
visit
to

of

throughout

carey
continued
the

performing
without

on
