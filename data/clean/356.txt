a
true
modern
classic
14
dec
1999
by
nigel
collier
vine™
voice
formatpaperback
my
favourite
eco
novel
and
one
of
my
alltime
favourite
books
i
keep
returning
to
this
informed
and
wonderfully
crafted
story
time
and
time
again
it
_is_
very
dense
but
eco's
narrative
style
is
so
smooth
and
captivating
that
it's
not
at
all
intimidating
just
like
'foucault's
pendulum'
with
all
its
hebrew
mysticism
and
kabballah
(which
i
love)
if
you
don't
like
the
incidental
stuff
(like
the
latin)
in
name
of
the
rose
then
just
plough
through
it

and
then
savour
the
richness
of
the
characterisation
and
the
clever
and
meticulously
dovetailed
intricacies
of
the
plot
which
is
unravelled
at
a
perfect
pace
before
you
the
basic
story
is
pure
conan
doyle

with
the
aptly
named
main
holmesesque
character
william
of
baskerville
being
one
of
the
most
wonderful
characters
of
any
book
i've
read
(on
a
par
with
john
le
carre's
barley
scott
blair

coincidentally
both
characters
being
played
by
sean
connery
in
the
movie
versions
of
their
respective
books)
baskerville
makes
the
same
observations
and
inferences
as
the
victorian
detective
and
even
says
elementary
as
a
playful
reference
to
his
fictional
mentor
(eco
has
that
sense
of
fun

like
concluding
that
an
encoded
scrap
of
paper
thought
to
hold
the
secrets
to
an
ancient
secret
world
order
of
templars
(in
foucault's
pendulum)
was
actually
just
a
shopping
list)
the
other
characters
at
the
monastery
are
utterly
vivid
disturbing
and
grotesque

straight
out
of
an
hieronymus
bosch
painting
i
really
can't
rate
this
book
highly
enough
eco
needn't
be
hard
work
he
does
try
and
be
clever
(which
let's
face
it
he
isvery
very
clever)
but
there's
no
need
to
get
bogged
down
by
the
peripheral
stuff
and
commentary
if
that's
not
your
thing
if
it
is
your
thing
then
this
novel
will
become
one
of
the
most
cherished
and
wellthumbed
items
in
your
book
case

just
don't
lick
your
finger
when
turning
the
pages(you'll
need
to
read
the
book
to
understand
that
last
comment)

25
sep

by
a

formatpaperback
i
can't
recommend
this
book
highly
enough
the
way
eco
unravels
the
labyrinthine
plot
whilst
evoking
with
such
supreme
stylistic
clarity
the
intrigues
seductive
heretical
undercurrents
and
atmosphere
of
a
time
and
a
place
unknown
to
us
is
little
short
of
extraordinary

the
late
medieval
world
is
given
a
forceful
and
remarkable
immediacy
that
draws
the
reader
in
and
focusses
attention
on
every
word
i'm
aware
that
people
have
found
the
background
detail
and
historical
elements
overly
imposing
and
generally
obstructing
to
the
plot
and
although
i
agree
to
a
point
(
adso's
description
of
the
church
door
in
one
of
the
opening
chapters
goes
on
far
too
long
and
doesn't
really
add
anything
)
those
who
complain
about
things
like
the
almost
obssesive
repetitions
of
the
doctrines
and
actions
of
fra
dolcino
as
slowing
down
the
narrative
miss
the
point
a
little
as
without
an
understanding
of
this
the
revelations
towards
the
end
of
the
book
seem
a
little
disingenuous
incidentally
the
parallels
between
the
library
of
the
monastery
and
that
of
the
library
described
in
the
jorge
luis
borges
story
'the
library
of
babel'
are
worth
noting
and
the
presence
of
a
character
named
jorge
of
burgos
surely
can't
be
a
coincidence
if
this

people
will
probably
either
love
or
hate
this
book
those
expecting
a
straight
forward
medieval
'whodunnit'
in
the
tradition
of
ellis
peters
might
be
in
for
a
little
surprize
as
umberto
eco
adds
a
great
deal
of
background
information
(history
theology
linguistics)
to
his
murder
mystery
for
adso
the
narrator
of
the
work
there
is
much
more
to
discover
than
just
the
identity
of
the
murderer
i
would
also
like
to
reassure
readers
who
might
think
that
knowledge
of
latin
is
essential
to
understanding
and
enjoying
this
work
it
is
not
a
good
grasp
of
latin
will
add
to
the
enjoyment
no
doubt
but
the
casual
reader
can
just
skip
through
the
quotations
what
is
given
in
latin
is
background
information
also
making
the
work
more
authentic
however
nothing
relevant
to
the
actual
plot
is
hidden
from
the
reader
who
only
knows
vernacular
languages
all
in
all
a
gripping
read
which
will
change
the
reader's
perception
of
libraries
for
ever!

hard
going

possibly
not
worth
the

for

the

is
one

the
