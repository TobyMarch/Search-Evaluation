kenneth
dwight
on
25
march
1947
the
eldest
child
of
stanley
and
only
child
of
sheila
eileen
dwight
(n&eacutee
harris)[12][13][14]
and
was
raised
in
pinner
middlesex
in
a
council
house
of
his
maternal
grandparents
his
parents
did
not
marry
until
he
was
6
years
old
when
the
family
moved
to
a
nearby
semidetached
house[15][16][17]
he
was
educated
at
pinner
wood
junior
school
reddiford
school
and
pinner
county
grammar
school
until
age
17
when
he
left
just
prior
to
his
a
level
examinations
to
pursue
a
career
in
the
music
industry[18][19][20]
when
john
began
to
seriously
consider
a
career
in
music
his
father
who
served
as
a
flight
lieutenant
in
the
royal
air
force
tried
to
steer
him
toward
a
more
conventional
career
such
as
banking[18]
john
has
stated
that
his
wild
stage
costumes
and
performances
were
his
way
of
letting
go
after
such
a
restrictive
childhood[20]
both
of
john's
parents
were
musically
inclined
his
father
having
been
a
trumpet
player
with
the
bob
millar
band
a
semiprofessional
big
band
that
played
at
military
dances[20]
the
dwights
were
keen
record
buyers
exposing
john
to
the
popular
singers
and
musicians
of
the
day
and
john
remembers
being
immediately
hooked
on
rock
and
roll
when
his
mother
brought
home
records
by
elvis
presley
and
bill
haley

his
comets
in
1956[18][19]
john
started
playing
the
piano
at
the
age
of
3
and
within
a
year
his
mother
heard
him
picking
out
winifred
atwell's
the
skater's
waltz
by
ear[18][19]
after
performing
at
parties
and
family
gatherings
at
the
age
of
7
he
took
up
formal
piano
lessons
he
showed
musical
aptitude
at
school
including
the
ability
to
compose
melodies
and
gained
some
notoriety
by
playing
like
jerry
lee
lewis
at
school
functions
at
the
age
of
11
he
won
a
junior
scholarship
to
the
royal
academy
of
music
according
to
one
of
his
instructors
john
promptly
played
back
like
a
gramophone
record
a
fourpage
piece
by
handel
that
he
heard
for
the
first
time[19]
for
the
next
five
years
he
attended
saturday
classes
at
the
academy
in
central
london
and
has
stated
that
he
enjoyed
playing
chopin
and
bach
and
singing
in
the
choir
during
saturday
classes
but
that
he
was
not
otherwise
a
diligent
classical
student[19]
i
kind
of
resented
going
to
the
academy
he
says
i
was
one
of
those
children
who
could
just
about
get
away
without
practising
and
still
pass
scrape
through
the
grades[19]
he
even
claims
that
he
would
sometimes
skip
classes
and
just
ride
around
on
the
tube[19]
however
several
instructors
have
testified
that
he
was
a
model
student
and
during
the
last
few
years
he
was
taking
lessons
from
a
private
tutor
in
addition
to
his
classes
at
the
academy[19]
john's
mother
though
also
strict
with
her
son
was
more
vivacious
than
her
husband
and
something
of
a
free
spirit
with
stanley
dwight
uninterested
in
his
son
and
often
physically
absent
john
was
raised
primarily
by
his
mother
and
maternal
grandmother

greatly
distressed
their
