it
used
to
be
that
disney
would
rerelease
its
old
animated
features
on
a
regular
schedule
into
theaters
reaching
a
new
audience
every
decade
or
so
with
surefire
quality
entertainment
that
made
parents
cheer
and
kept
kids
entertained
that
equation
was
upset
with
the
rise
of
home
video

but
disney
has
found
a
way
to
go
back
to
the
well
on
a
new
path
3d
so
the
studio
rereleased
its
oscarwinning
beauty
and
the
beast
in
a
retrofitted
3d
version
that
didn't
really
solve
the
problem
of
turning
twodimensional
drawings
into
threedimensional
images
but
with
this
week's
release
of
finding
nemo
3d
that
equation
has
been
solved
as
well
nemo
after
all
is
a
fully
digital
production
a
pixar
computeranimated
marvel
that
won
the
oscar
in
2004
one
has
to
assume
that
the
translation
of
digital
images
from
two
to
three
dimensions
is
a
lot
less
challenging
than
trying
to
add
a
third
dimension
to
flat
drawings
nemo
features
albert
brooks
as
marlin
a
nervous
clownfish
on
the
great
barrier
reef
off
australia
he's
a
single
parent
having
lost
his
mate
to
a
barracuda
shortly
before
their
sole
remaining
egg
hatched
now
he
nervously
attends
to
his
offspring
nemo
(alexander
gould
whose
childlike
voice
has
obviously
matured
into
what
it
is
as
shane
botwin
on
weeds)
who
wants
to
spread
his
um
fins
and
go
to
school
then
on
his
first
day
of
school
on
a
dare
from
classmates
nemo
ventures
out
into
the
open
ocean

and
is
promptly
captured
by
a
scuba
diver
who
pops
him
into
his
boat
and
heads
back
to
sydney
the
distraught
marlin
sets
off
in
pursuit
eventually
teaming
up
with
a
blue
tang
dory
(ellen
degeneres)
goodnatured
but
with
a
shorttermmemory
deficiency
to
track
nemo
down
and
rescue
him
the
rest
of
the
film
is
divided
between
marlin
and
dory's
trek

with
sharks
jellyfish
and
other
underwater
hazards

and
nemo's
escape
efforts
from
a
dentist's
aquarium
in
an
office
near
sydney
harbor
it
is
pixar
perfection
an
energetic
blend
of
exciting
action
photorealistic
visuals
wellwritten
jokes
and
outstanding
voice
casting
(including
among
others
willem
dafoe
brad
garrett
allison
janney
and
geoffrey
rush)
ten
years
later
it
holds
its
own
its
director
andrew
stanton
may
still
be
licking
his
wounds
from
his
latest
film
john
carter
but
he
can
hold
his
head
up
proudly
for
this
film
(and
of
course
his
subsequent
pixar
output
including
wall*e
another
oscar
winner)
did
finding
nemo
require
3dification?
(or
should
that
be
deification?)
not
really
the
3d
gives
the
images
a
little
more
depth
but
they
already
had
heft
and
weight
the
3d
is
a
moneymaking
gimmick
nothing
more
on
the
other
hand
this
blatant
moneygrab
does
offer
one
of
those
rare
chances
for
a
family
to
see
a
disney
classic
on
a
big
screen

completely
agree
with
this
review
we
actually
left
the
theater
early
because
our
2
year
old
who
actually
loves
watching
nemo
was
bored
this
was
nothing
more
than
a
way
to
make
extra
money
the
3d
was
not
worth
paying
the
extra
$3
per
ticket
it
made
the
movie
darker
and
lost
it's
rich
blue
color
and
really
dulled
it
out
the
3d
effects
in
the
promo
with
the
'depsicable
me'
minions
was
10
times
better
and
it
only
lasted
for
1
minute
tops
we
still
love
nemo
but
we
have
decided
not
to
waste
our
money
on
any
more
of
these
3d
films
i
would
just
go
if
your
bored
nothing
more
ckmyers2
completely
