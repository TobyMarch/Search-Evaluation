after
12
years
of
thinking
about
it
(and
waiting
for
movie
technology
to
catch
up
with
his
visions)
james
cameron
followed
up
his
unsinkable
titanic
with
avatar
a
scifi
epic
meant
to
trump
all
previous
scifi
epics
set
in
the
future
on
a
distant
planet
avatar
spins
a
simple
little
parable
about
greedy
colonizers
(that
would
be
mankind)
messing
up
the
lush
tribal
world
of
pandora
a
paraplegic
marine
named
jake
(sam
worthington)
acts
through
a
9foottall
avatar
that
allows
him
to
roam
the
planet
and
pass
as
one
of
the
na'vi
the
blueskinned
largeeyed
native
people
who
would
very
much
like
to
live
their
peaceful
lives
without
the
interference
of
the
visitors
although
he's
supposed
to
be
gathering
intel
for
the
badass
general
(stephen
lang)
who'd
like
to
lay
waste
to
the
planet
and
its
inhabitants
jake
naturally
begins
to
take
a
liking
to
the
na'vi
especially
the
feisty
neytiri
(zo&euml
saldana
whose
entire
performance
recorded
by
cameron's
complicated
motioncapture
system
exists
as
a
digitally
rendered
na'vi)
the
movie
uses
stateoftheart
3d
technology
to
plunge
the
viewer
deep
into
cameron's
crazy
toy
box
of
planetary
ecosystems
and
hightech
machinery
maybe
it's
the
fact
that
cameron
seems
torn
between
his
two
lovesawesome
destructive
gizmos
and
flowerpower
message
mongeringthat
makes
avatar's
pursuit
of
its
point
ultimately
uncertain
that
and
the
fact
that
cameron's
dialogue
continues
to
clunk
badly
if
you're
won
over
by
the
movie's
trippy
new
world
the
characters
will
be
forgivable
as
broad
useful
archetypes
rather
than
standardissue
stereotypes
and
you
might
be
able
to
overlook
the
unsurprising
central
plot
(the
overextended
take
that
michael
bay
final
battle
sequences
could
tax
even
cameron
enthusiasts
however)
it
doesn't
measure
up
to
the
hype
(what
could?)
yet
avatar
frequently
hits
a
giddy
delirium

comments
this
dvd
had
great
cinematography
and
amazing
visual
effects
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
parts
of
the
film
was
when
jake
was
walking
through
the
forest
of
pandora

everything
lit
up
and
looked
amazing
the
movie
had
a
great
soundtrack
it
had
a
new
age
feel
that
felt
like
it
was
inviting
you
into
a
new
world
it
made
the
whole
thing
seem
tangible
which
is
great
i
wanted
to
be
part
of
that
world
the
acting
was
great
too!
you
could
tell
which
characters
were
bad
and
which
were
good
with
some
bad
sides
overall
one
of
the
best
movies
i've
seen
the
actors
roles
fit
their
appearance
and
there
was
a
lot
of
foreshadowing
and
hinting
throughout
the
movie

i'm
primarily
interested
in
the
storyline
differences
between
special
sets
and
their
theatrical
counterparts
so
here
are
the
differences
between
the
two
(note
spoilers
follow)
the
extended
collector's
edition
runs
16
minutes
28
seconds
longer
than
the
theatrical
cut
and
listed
below
are
the
major
differences
1)
the
opening
scene
is
different
and
starts
with
jake
in
a
wheelchair
on
earth
in
a
blade
runneresque
earth
city
the
scene
moves
to
scenes
of
jake
in
his
apartment
then
taking
liquid
shots
in
a
bar
jake's
narration
of
i
told
myself
i
can
pass
any
test
a
man
can
pass
and
they
can
fix
the
spinal
if
you
got
the
money
but
not
on
vet
benefits
not
in
this
economy
are
inserted
during
this
new
opening
scene
jake
beats
up
a
bar
patron
who
is
mistreating
a
woman
and
then
jake
and
wheelchair
are
unceremoniously
thrown
outside
by
bouncers
into
an
alley
while
in
the
alley
jake
meets
the
two
rda
representatives
who
bring
him
news
of
his
brother's
untimely
death
then
the
movie
cuts
back
to
the
original
theatrical
cut
where
jake
sees
his
brother's
body
cremated
then
awakes
in
space
2)
during
jake's
initial
flyover
of
pandora
in
his
avatar
they
witness
a
herd
of
sturmbeasts
buffalolike
creatures
3)
after
seeing
the
sturmbeasts
grace
jake
and
norm
stop
by
grace's
old
english
school
for
the
na'vi
the
school
is
now
closed
abandoned
and
some
walls
are
riddled
with
bulletholes
norm
finds
a
dr
seuss
book
the
lorax
on
the
ground
this
scene
explains
how
neytiri
knew
english
so
well
and
certainly
gives
some
further
backstory
into
grace
augustine's
character
interestingly
the
lorax
can
be
seen
as
a
metaphor
for
the
pandoran
story
recall
that
the
seemingly
simple
seussian
book
is
actually
a
lesson
on
the
plight
of
the
environment
and
industrialization
4)
we
see
some
other
different
pandoran
flora
and
fauna
particularly
with
scenes
of
the
luminescent
forest
floor
5)
jake's
first
dinner
with
neytiri
is
longer
and
extended
and
it's
here
that
she
tells
him
her
full
name
6)
when
jake
grace
and
norm
first
visit
the
hallelujah
mountains
on
the
way
to
the
remote
uplink
station
grace
explains
(in
a
jake
voiceover)
that
the
mountains
are
levitated
[via
the
meissner
effect]
because
unobtanium
is
a
superconductor
there's
a
pretty
spectacular
cgi
shot
as
the
characters
look
around
in
awe
at
the
suspended
mountains
7)
pictures
of
grace
and
na'vi
children
at
her
previously
functioning
school
dr
augustine
tells
jake
that
she
previously
taught
neytiri
and
her
sister
sylwanin
however
one
day
sylwanin
and
some
hunters
destroyed
an
rda
bulldozer
and
rda
secops
troopers
killed
them
at
the
school
which
explains
why
the
school
walls
were
previously
seen
pockmarked
with
bullet
holes
8)
sturmbeast
hunting
scene
after
jake
tames
a
banshee
after
jake
successfully
kills
a
sturmbeast
with
an
arrow
he
and
neytiri
chortle
a
heck
yeah!
and
whoop
9)
jake
and
neytiri's
love
scene
comprises
them
linking
braids
together
some
kissing
nothing
explicit
10)
tsu'tey
leads
a
war
party
that
destroys
the
rda's
autonomous
bulldozers
as
well
as
the
rda
secops
squad
that
was
guarding
them
corporal
wainfleet
leads
the
search
party
that
uncovers
the
evidence
via
realtime
helmet
cam
footage
not
sure
why
they
cut
this
scene
from
the
theatrical
cut
as
it
persuades
selfridge
to
attack
the
home
tree
11)
attack
of
hammerhead
titanotheres
on
rda
forces
has
been
extended
slightly
additional
scenes
of
ampsuits
getting
destroyed
12)
fight
between
colonel
quaritch
in
amp
suit
and
neytiri
on
thanator
slightly
longer
13)
tsu'tey's
death
scene
in
the
theatrical
cut
he
falls
off
the
rda
shuttle's
aft
ramp
to
his
death
in
the
collector's
edition
he
falls
to
the
forest
floor
mortally
wounded
he
passes
on
leadership
to
jake
and
asks
jake
to
ceremonially
kill
him
eg
harakiri
so
that
jake
will
be
the
last
shadow
that
tsutey
sees
jake
does
so
i
preferred
the
original
tsu'tey
death
scene
which
was
more
dramatic
jake
had
afterall
already
become
the
de
facto
clan
leader
by
that
point
in
the
movie
so
further
formal
transfer
by
tsu'tey
(a
minor
character)
seemed
unnecessary

great
transfer

january

by
thomas

i
got
this
as
soon
as
i
found
it
available
on
the
net
it
will
not
be
available
commercially
for
some
time
and
that
of
course
means
the
price
is
way
to
high
for
most
viewers
i
was
willing
to
be
taken
for
a
ride
but
if
you
do
not
just
have
to
have
it
now
i
would
recommend
waiting
until
it
is
available
everywhere
the
video
quality
is
fantastic
i
have
a
samsung
40
3d
setup
and
the
movie
was
just
beautiful
to
watch
not
quite
the
same
as
imax
but
very
close
(size
of
screen
being
the
only
difference
that
i
could
see)
the
3d
is
to
my
eyes
exactly
as
good
as
the
imax
onscreen
version
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
movie
but
believe
me
i
would
tell
you
if
the
video
quality
was
not
great
i
would
not
hesitate
to
do
the
purchase
again
(even
considering
the
huge
ripoff
in
price
at
this
time)
but
advise
others
to
consider
if
you
really
have
to
have
it
right
now
or
can
wait
awhile
great
movie
almost
unbelievable
video
transfer
quality
and
a
price
that
is
just
not
right!
hope
this
helps

l
theobald
formatbluray
there
are
many
low
score
reviews
purely
based
on
the
fact
there
was
a
release
of
this
movie
earlier
this
year
and
now
the
extended
version
comes
out
feels
like
a
marketing
game
when
the
first
release
happened
it
was
known
an
extended
version
was
coming
but
some
people
just
had
to
have
it
now
i
just
watched
it
on
netflix
and
waited
for
the
extended
version
i
agree
if
you
bought
the
first
release
version
you
have
little
real
reason
to
buy
the
extended
version
unless
you
love
this
movie
and
want
the
bonus
features
some
of
the
other
low
scores
talk
about
the
3d
version
coming
but
that
is
weak
reason
for
most
people
because
most
do
not
own
and
will
not
own
a
3d
tv
set
if
you
do
your
research
on
3d
tvs
you
will
find
they
clunky
and
costly
unless
you
are
among
the
few
who
have
a
3d
tv
then
there
is
no
reason
to
wait
to
buy
this
release
of
avatar
if
you
enjoyed
the
movie
for
the
few
who
have
never
seen
the
movie
the
key
factors
to
consider
is
if
you
are
a
science
fiction
fan
enjoy
action
movies
and
if
you
consider
yourself
picky
about
dialog/originality
avatar
breaks
no
new
ground
when
it
comes
to
story
but
it
does
take
many
of
successful
elements
from
other
stories
and
rolls
it
into
this
one
the
bashing
on
acting
is
overkill
in
general
they
did
a
fine
job
not
exceptional
but
anyone
who
loves
science
fiction
will
find
the
acting
a
step
above
the
normal
for
this
type
of
movie
the
dialog
is
nothing
special
there
are
mostly
cliche
characters
and
situations
the
key
is
the
entire
package
is
very
well
done
no
movie
is
perfect
and
as
much
as
some
people
bash
this
just
look
at
the
box
office
sales
bad
movies
would
have
never
set
top
sales
records
no
matter
how
much
marketing
was
behind
it
this
movie
is
not
for
everyone
but
it
is
good
to
great
entertainment
for
many
bottom
line
if
you
loved
the
movie
and
do
not
own
it
you
might
want
to
get
this
if
you
have
never
seen
the
movie
rent
it
or
barrow
it
first
it
is
a
science
fiction
classic
worth
consideration
for
most
people
