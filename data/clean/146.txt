better

this
was
meant
to
be
the
record
that
brought
them
back
to
earth
after
three
years
of
studio
experimentation
instead
it
took
them
all
over
the
place
continuing
to
burst
the
envelope
of
pop
music
lennon
and
mccartney
were
still
at
the
height
of
their
powers
with
lennon
in
particular
growing
into
one
of
rock's
towering
figures
but
even
mccartney
could
still
rock
and
the
amazement
on
helter
skelter
was
that
he
had
vocal
cords
at
the
end
from
beach
boys
knockoffs
to
reggae
and
to
the
unknown

by

formataudio
cd
there
are
a
few
albums
from
the
rock
era
that
i
feel
i've
been
in
a
relationship
with
since
the
first
day
i
got
them
the
beatles
is
one
of
those
albums
i
found
it
under
my
christmas
tree
in
1968
and
i've
been
engaged
with
it
at
some
level
ever
since
it
is
not
the
best
beatles
album
objectively
nor
is
it
my
favorite
but
it
has
always
compelled
my
attention
at
the
time
it
came
out
i
was
12
but
even
then
it
was
clear
that
we
were
no
longer
in
pepperland
or
on
a
magical
mystery
tour
this
album
wasn't
yet
more
progress
toward
some
new
musical
form
musically
it
embraced
values
never
before
associated
with
the
beatles
as
i
understood
them
parody
pastiche
rock
and
roll
revivalism
musichall
nostalgia
avantgarde
experimentation
political
agitation
intimate
confession
trivial
nonsense
it
is
simply
a
series
of
highly
personal
statements
from
the
three
songwriters
coalescing
around
no
particular
theme
other
than
the
right
to
personal
expression
the
beatles
is
not
to
me
the
sound
of
the
beatles
breaking
up
that's
the
storyline
a
lot
of
beatle
historians
apply
to
this
album
if
they're
basing
this
judgement
on
the
fact
that
the
individual
songwriters'
imprints
are
on
each
song
you'd
have
to
argue
that
the
breakup
began
much
earlier
around
the
time
of
beatles
for
sale
or
help!
lennonmccartney
were
rarely
a
songwriting
team
in
the
sense
of
george
and
ira
gershwin
their
partnership
was
always
about
strategy
ie
how
to
ensure
that
thirdrate
songs
would
not
be
included
on
albums
just
for
the
sake
of
fairness
the
beatles
instead
simply
shows
the
evolution
of
each
of
the
three
songwriters
(on
this
album
george
emerges
dramatically)
as
they
each
embraced
new
musical
ideas
and
applied
their
life
experiences
to
their
art
having
helped
break
all
the
molds
for
what
was
acceptable
songwriting
in
their
previous
work
they
each
now
proceeded
to
take
full
advantage
of
the
freedom
they'd
won
some
of
the
dumber
cuts
on
the
beatles
demonstrate
perhaps
the
expression
freedom's
just
another
word
for
nothing
left
to
lose
paul
in
particular
seemed
frightened
to
step
out
too
often
without
the
crutch
of
some
existing
form
that
he
could
parody
or
pay
tribute
to
ie
honey
pie
back
in
the
ussr
or
rocky
racoon
but
while
you
can
say
that
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
in
this
massive
album
there
are
perhaps
half
a
dozen
paul
songs
that
are
among
his
best
and
most
original
i
will
blackbird
mother
nature's
son
helter
skelter
for
four
examples
lennon's
direction
was
to
become
more
nakedly
confessional
as
befits
someone
who
was
dealing
with
such
turbulent
emotions
at
the
time
he
gives
us
some
of
his
most
beautiful
songs
like
dear
prudence
and
some
of
his
most
intense
like
i'm
so
tired
revolution
yer
blues
and
sexy
sadie
often
as
in
the
continuing
story
of
bungalow
bill
glass
onion
or
everybody
has
something
to
hide
except
for
me
and
my
monkey
he
seems
to
be
writing
in
code
and
that
sense
of
allusiveness
gives
the
album
much
of
its
cracked
character
and
of
course
he's
the
guy
who
assembled
the

and

george
seems
to
be
captured
here
in
a
moment
of
great
selfdiscovery
as
an
artist
you
can
hear
his
talent
finally
come
together
in
while
my
guitar
gently
weeps
which
i
remember
at
age
12
was
to
my
ears
the
best
thing
on
the
albumand
still
seems
to
be
so
prior
to
the
white
album
he
had
these
cautious
little
songs
on
the
early
albums
and
then
embraced
india
which
while
sometimes
satisfying
seemed
weird
and
out
of
place
his
songs
here
sets
the
stage
for
something
here
comes
the
sun
and
then
his
monumental
early
solo
work
at
age
12
i
thought
long
long
long
was
a
emotional
powerhouseand
i
still
do
a
few
months
after
i
got
the
beatles
the
charles
manson
murders
took
place
and
eventually
the
da
made
the
case
that
somehow
insanely
the
murders
were
inspired
by
songs
on
this
album
around
the
same
time
the
media
were
full
of
bizarre
speculation
that
paul
mccartney
was
dead
and
that
clues
were
all
over
this
album
it's
no
accident
that
halfinsane
people
might
mine
the
beatles
for
hidden
messages
and
evidence
of
conspiracies
the
world
it
depicts
is
strange
and
almost
claustrophobicall
the
more
so
for
its
haphazard
approach
and
its
odd
switches
in
tone
from
childish
delight
to
fiendish
paranoia
but
even
those
of
us
who
live
normal
lives
and
dream
normal
dreams
can
acknowledge
that
the
beatles
has
a
hold
on
your
consciousness
that
is
unlike
anything
else
the
group
did
and
unlike
anything
else
that
came
out
of
the
rock
era

cd
to
all
the
golden
eared
audiophiles
who
can
hear
all
the
differences
in
this
30th
anniversery
reissue
i
say
what
a
bunch
of
whooee
this
is
the
exact
same
master
as
the
1987
release
no
differencenada
please
notice
the
amazon
listing
has
been
changed
from
remastered
to
original
recording
it's
amazing
how
much
psycology
is
at
work
when
people
listen
if
they
believe
it's
remastered
their
ear
will
trick
them
into
believing
it
sounds
different
don't
believe
it
so
that
means
all
of
us
beatle
fans
have
forked
over
thirysome
odd
dollars
for
the
exact
same
product
that
we
had
the
question
is
capital/emi
why
the
h
didn't
you
remaster
this?
the
white
album
is
one
of
the
most
poorly
remastered
discs
in
the
beatles
catalog
(but
it's
got
some
stiff
competition
the
first
four
albums
for
starters)
it's
unfathomable
to
me
that
capital/emi
would
ask
beatles
fans
to
shell
out
that
kind
of
money
for
an
unimproved
product
and
a
product
that
sorely
needed
improvement
what
we're
supposed
to
be
happy
to
pay
over
thirty
dollars
for
ridiculous
miniture
artwork
which
you
need
a
magnifying
glass
to
read
and
see?
come
on
capital/emi!
that's
highway
robbery
and
you
know
it!
with
all
the
money
you've
already
made
on
the
beatles'
catalog
this
is
a
particular
heinous
crime
so
capital/emi
what
about
actually
remastering
the
beatles
catalog?
they
are
only
considered
the
greatest
musical
force
of
the
last
half
of
the
20th
century
the
who's
catalog
has
been
remastered
the
byrds
catalog
has
been
remastered
even
the
hollies
catalog
was
wonderfully
remastered
for
their
box
set
(by
you
emi!
)
it
seems
a
tragic
bitter
irony
that
perhaps
the
most
musical
of
all
the
artists
of
the
60s
gets
the
shoddiest
of
digital
remastering
as
far
as
the
actual
album
goes
find
the
vinyl
it
just
sounds
much
better
better
bass
much
less
harshness
i've
got
the
mobile
fidelity
lp
and
it
is
a
delight
to
listen
to
i
probably
should
just
throw
away
my
cds
as
for
the
raging
debate
between
beatle
lovers
and
beatle
haters
regarding
the
merits
of
this
album
here
are
a
few
things
to
ponder
this
album
was
made
as
the
beatles
were
still
transitioning
from
having
a
manager
and
being
a
cohesive
unit
to
managing
themselves
(unwisely)
and
being
four
distinctly
different
people
with
less
and
less
in
common
it
was
also
the
introduction
of
yoko
to
the
ranks
which
probably
really
hastened
the
split
the
album
was
made
in
this
atmosphere
of
rapid
changing
dynamics
within
the
group
it
was
also
made
over
quite
a
long
period
of
time
may
through
october
of
'68
the
fairly
closeknit
bunch
that
gathered
at
george's
home
to
make
demos
of
their
new
songs
in
may
were
disparate
disenchanted
individuals
by
the
time
they
finished
the
album
in
october
much
has
been
made
of
them
recording
parts
of
this
album
separately
that
only
became
true
towards
the
end
of
the
sessions
and
only
because
they
had
gone
way
past
their
deadline
and
needed
to
finish
the
album
quickly
plus
that
really
applied
mostly
to
overdubs
so
bottom
line
on
the
white
album
it
probably
does
go
on
too
long
but
that
is
probably
part
of
its
charm
there
is
certainly
no
other
album
in
the
beatles
catalog
that
remotely
resembles
it
also
much
debate
over
the
inclusion
of
revolution
9

does
it
belong
on
the
album?
well
it's
on
there
and
i
suppose
that's
part
of
its
charm
as
well
i
do
listen
to
it
from
time
to
time
and
really
it's
not
either
unlistenable
or
unmusical
i
fact
if
you've
had
the
unfortunate
experience
to
listen
to
any
of
john

yoko's
avantgarde
recordings
you'll
find
this
much
more
listenable
in
the
end
it's
down
to
the
songs
and
how
they
are
performed
and
produced
with
a
decent
remaster
these
songs
stand
up
performance
and
productionwise
they
capture
the
songwriters
still
operating
at
peak
power
(much
time
and
inspiration
to
apply
to
their
craft
while
in
india)
in
fact
john
said
more
than
once
that
he
was
very
proud
of
his
songs
on
the
white
album
i'm
sure
macca
would
say
the
same
weaker
songs
like
don't
pass
me
by
and
long
long
long
add
to
the
character
and
mystique
of
the
album
goodnight
is
a
beautiful
lullaby
the
perfect
antidote
to
revolution
9
and
the
perfect
closer
for
the
album
the
white
album
is
an
oddessy
it's
a
trip
through
many
musical
styles
and
the
journey
of
a
group
whose
cracks
are
beginning
to
show
albeit
in
a
charming
way
i
certainly
don't
think
for
a
minute
this
is
their
best
work
far
from
it
but
the
stength
of
the
songs
and
the
strength
of
the
band
itself
show
through
and
make
this
well
another
essential
beatles
album
but
hold
out
if
you
haven't
bought
it
force
capital
/emi
to
give
this
album
the
remaster
it
deserves

cd
the
above
rating
is
not
for
the
quality
of
the
beatles'
performances
the
album
rates
up
there
with
sgt
pepper
revolver
rubber
soul
and
abbey
road
let
me
then
explain
why
it
deserves
the
rating
at
the
time
of
its
initial
release
on
vinyl
the
music
portrayed
an
encyclopedia
of
music
styles
from
hard
rock
(helter
skelter)
to
blues
(yer
blues)
to
jazz
(honey
pie)
to
country
(rocky
raccoon)
to
beach
boys
surf
(back
in
the
ussr)
its
cover
was
inspired
by
the
white
art
of
yoko
and
individually
numbered
like
works
of
art
in
fact
number
1
has
recently
turned
up
then
in
1987
it
was
released
on
cd
on
two
separate
discs
packaged
together
in
a
longbox
then
later
it
was
repackaged
in
a
double
cd
clamshell
which
was
the
start
of
its
downfall
it
listed
the
songs
for
disc
one
and
then
dics
(sic)
two
as
far
as
i
am
aware
this
gaffe
still
exists
then
we
come
to
this
latest
repackaging
yes
it
was
a
nice
way
to
commemorate
the
30th
anniversary
by
presenting
it
in
a
mini
album
format
complete
with
gatefold
sleeve
poster
and
four
mini
pictures
of
the
beatles
however
one
begs
the
question
why
wasn't
it
remastered?
sgt
pepper
was
to
be
remastered
in
mono
for
its
30th
anniversary
that
was
pulled
much
to
the
fans
displeasure
then
the
execs
at
apple
didn't
want
to
pass
up
on
the
white
album
so
they
simple
dressed
up
the
packaging
charged
extra
and
left
the
remastering
circa
1987!
why
not
put
out
the
mono
mix?
piggies
blackbird
helter
skelter
don't
pass
me
by
have
subtleties
that
would
sound
refreshing
today
in
fact
happiness
is
a
warm
gun
in
mono
corrects
a
mixing
error
left
in
the
stereo
the
instrumental
bridge
actually
had
john's
middle
8
sung
over
it
he
actually
sang
that
twice
however
in
mixing
out
the
first
one
for
the
stereo
they
didn't
do
it
completely
because
you
can
hear
the
last
half
of
the
word
down
before
he
repeats
it
the
mono
mixes
this
out
completely!
as
i
have
stated
before
the
beatles
catalog
demands
an
overhaul
maybe
if
enough
fans
complain
we'll
see
it
happen!
