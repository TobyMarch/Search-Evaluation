this
was

october

2002
by
31year

wallflower
formataudio
cd
because
empty
sky
didn't
see
an
american
release
elton
john's
selftitled
second
album
was
what
first
caused
people
to
take
notice
of
england's
newest
music
sensation
this
was
probably
not
a
bad
idea
because
after
the
ambitiousashell
empty
sky
the
followup
gave
us
the
bare
essence
of
what
elton

lyricist
bernie
taupin
were
all
about
insanelycatchy
melodies

intelligent
lyrics
pop
music
hadn't
seen
the
like
of
since
the
arrival
of
bob
dylan
(a
huge
influence
on
the
duo
for
sure)
so
if
elton
john
(1970)
must
be
the
beginning
of
elton's
legacy
(although
an
inaccurate
one)
so
be
it
of
course
this
is
the
destination
for
your
song
which
is
probably
still
the
#1
favorite
song
for
elton
fans
around
the
world
(even
nonfans
like
my
mom)
elton

bernie's
love
songs
were
still
rather
direct
around
this
time
so
your
song
was
a
perfect
choice
for
a
first
major
hit
single
as
any
even
as
the
duo's
explorations
into
love
songs
became
more
complex
(the
comingofage
first
episode
at
hienton
already
shows
the
transformation
starting)
your
song
still
dazzles
with
its
heartfelt
simplicity
(not
to
mention
its
guaranteed
appearance
in
any
concert
playlist)
while
empty
sky
tried
to
jam
too
many
genres
onto
one
album
(or
often
on
one
song)
elton
john
kind
of
continues
that
ethic
but
it
coalesces
more
this
time
around
the
harpsichord
that
beautifully
adorned
skyline
pigeon
makes
another
appearance
on
i
need
you
to
turn
to
while
sixty
years
on
(both
songs
looking
at
the
ravages
of
age
from
men
who
were
still
in
their
early
20s!)
the
greatest
discovery
(about
the
birth
of
bernie's
younger
brother)

the
king
must
die
show
the
emerging
influence
of
conductor
paul
buckmaster
the
lyrics
show
bernie
making
that
leap
into
songwriting
master
unlike
on
empty
sky
where
he
seemed
too
eager
to
impress
but
border
song
is
another
song
that
amazes
with
its
simplebutvalid
call
for
peace

tolerance

was
therefore
a
natural
cover
for
aretha
franklin
who
took
elton
into
the
american
top
40
for
the
first
time
those
who
know
elton
as
a
slick
purveyor
of
adult
contemporary
pop
nowadays
might
be
surprised
to
know
he
did
a
fair
share
of
rocking
early
in
his
career

elton
john
shows
him
not
afraid
to
tear
it
up
take
me
to
the
pilot
is
another
surefire
concert
rouser
(even
with
its
indecipherable
lyrics)
no
shoe
strings
on
louise
is
elton's
hatsoff
to
the
stones
with
a
countryrocker
that
might
have
been
at
home
on
sticky
fingers
(which
would
come
out
the
next
year)
the
cage
is
almost
funky
with
its
santanainspired
congas

lyrics
about
wanting
to
break
free
from
the
conformity
the
outside
world
imposes
upon
us
the
inclusion
of
bonus
tracks
is
indeed
a
pleasure
this
time
around
but
like
those
of
empty
sky
they're
hit

miss
at
best
bad
side
of
the
moon
is
another
one
of
those
whattheheckisitabout
tunes
that
bernie
found
coming
from
his
pen
back
in
the
early
days
(but
could
pink
floyd
have
found
their
inspiration
for
dark
side
of
the
moon
here?)
grey
seal
would
later
be
remade
for
goodbye
yellow
brick
road
(1973)

it's
a
song
that's
still
very
much
in
demo
form
at
this
stage
interesting
only
to
hear
how
much
better
it
would
soon
get
rock

roll
madonna
on
the
other
hand
is
a
song
that
definitely
should
have
made
the
album!
again
it's
a
tune
that
will
quiet
all
carps
that
elton
couldn't
really
rock

he
contributes
some
of
his
best
piano
playing
ever
(saying
a
whole
lot)
proving
his
debt
to
jerry
lee
lewis

other
piano
pounders
the
lyrics
seem
to
be
about
a
fastliving
groupie
which
in
retrospect
are
a
bit
more
ironic
than
they
may
have
sounded
at
the
time
elton
john
sure
enough
introduced
america
to
the
young
man
from
middlesex
england
who
would
change
the
face
of
pop
music
it

so
successful
that
elton
would
soon
be
called
on
to

two

a
year

also
tour
behind

(if
that's
not
a
busy

tell

what
is)
both
albums
of
that
year
would
go
platinum
virtually
on
release

help
make
elton
probably
the
most
successful
musician
of
the
1970s
(exactly
who
that
is
is
open
to
debate)
it

still

cd
elton
john's
second
album
(released
in
1970)
finally
established
him
in
the
pantheon
of
upandcomers
to
watch
with
gus
dudgeon's
gorgeous
production
and
paul
buckmaster's
string
arrangements
ej
now
had
a
team
worthy
of
his
music
your
song
remains
the
haunting
love
song
of
the
ages
border
song
is
a
lush
stringandpiano
paean
to
tolerance
sixty
years
on
is
a
stirring
narrative
with
frightening
sometimes
unfathomable
lyrics
by
bernie
taupin
first
episode
on
hienton
is
the
only
track
that
harkens
back
to
ej's
first
album
empty
sky
it
is
noteworthy
for
the
eerie
mellotron
playing
and
contains
some
of
bernie's
most
ambitious
lyrics
up
to
that
time
elton
pulls
some
new
tricks
out
of
his
hat
with
no
shoe
strings
on
louise
surprising
listeners
with
an
attempt
at
honkytonk
that
only
partially
gels
the
king
must
die
is
a
comment
on
a
monarch
who
is
slowly
but
surely
losing
control
of
his
reign
and
frantically
looks
for
a
way
to
save
his
skin
from
those
who
are
about
to
overthrow
him
take
me
to
the
pilot
and
the
cage
are
decent
songs
left
very
much
to
interpretation
however
they
sound
rather
dated
particularly
the
latter
track
still
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
listen
the
rereleased
cd
sounds
much
better
than
the
original
mca
releases
which
were
sonically
inferior
by
a
heck
of
a
lot
finally
the
music
sounds
the
way
it
was
supposed
to
the
sonics
are
full
and
buckmaster's
strings
never
sounded
better
full
liner
notes
and
lyrics
from
the
original
lp
are
available
in
this
package
making
this
a
musthave
for
any
elton
fan

cd
this
selftitled
album
was
elton
john's
second
and
breakthrough
release
in
america
mr
john
and
bernie
taupin
had
been
collaborating
for
a
few
years
but
they
really
started
to
gel
as
a
team
on
this
release
the
album
has
almost
a
baroque
sound
to
it
with
alot
of
strings
harpsicords
and
airy
syntheseisers
of
course
everyone
knows
the
megahit
your
song
but
the
album
contains
others
that
would
become
elton
john
classics
sixty
years
on
is
a
stirring
lament
about
growing
old
the
greatest
discovery
is
a
sweet
ode
to
the
birth
of
a
brother
while
the
king
must
die
ends
the
album
in
dark
epic
fashion
i
need
you
to
turn
to

first
episode
at
hienton
carry
on
in
the
somberlike
tone
the
album
is
dominated
by
but
not
regulated
to
classical
stylings
no
shoestrings
on
louise
has
a
country
twang
the
cage
is
a
funky
rocker
while
both
take
me
to
the
pilot

the
border
song
have
gospel
influences
(aretha
franklin
had
a
big
hit
with
border)
while
not
as
radiofriendly
as
future
elton
john
releases
this
album
has
an
experimental
feel
and
is
worth
repeat
