trivia
originally
titled
king
of
the
jungle
it
was
supposed
to
be
about
african
lions
living
in
the
jungle
until
the
production
team
realized
that
lions
don't
live
in
the
jungle
interestingly
enough
the
phrase
king
of
the
jungle
is
still
used
on
certain
tshirts
sold
at
the
disney
store

goofs
continuity
when
simba
is
talking
to
scar
about
the
graveyard
scar
says
and
he's
absolutely
right!
far
too
dangerous!
only
the
bravest
lions
go
there!
scar
is
sitting
up
and
looks
off
to
the
right
of
the
screen
but
in
the
next
shot
he
is
sitting
down
with
paws
