two
policeman
sir
thomas
legge
and
inspector
maine
discuss
the
perplexing
indian
island
case
they
have
reconstructed
much
of
what
happened
on
indian
island
from
diaries
kept
by
various
guests
it
is
clear
to
them
that
the
murderer
was
not
blore
lombard
or
vera
when
they
arrived
the
police
found
the
chair
vera
kicked
away
to
hang
herself
mysteriously
set
upright
against
the
wall
we
learn
that
isaac
morris
who
hired
lombard
and
blore
and
bought
the
island
in
the
name
of
u
n
owen
died
of
an
apparent
sleepingpill
overdose
the
night
the
guests
arrived
on
the
island
the
police
suspect
that
morris
was
murdered
the
police
know
that
the
people
of
sticklehaven
were
instructed
to
ignore
any
distress
signals
from
the
island
they
were
told
that
everything
taking
place
on
the
island
was
part
of
a
game
being
played
by
the
wealthy
owners
of
the
island
and
their
guests
the
rest
of
the
epilogue
takes
the
form
of
a
manuscript
in
a
bottle
found
by
a
fisherman
and
given
to
the
police
it
is
written
by
judge
wargrave
who
writes
that
the
manuscript
offers
the
solution
to
an
unsolved
crime
he
says
he
was
a
sadistic
child
with
both
a
lust
for
killing
and
a
strong
sense
of
justice
reading
mysteries
always
satisfied
him
he
went
into
law
an
appropriate
career
for
him
because
it
allowed
him
to
indulge
his
zeal
for
death
within
the
confines
of
the
law
watching
guilty
persons
squirm
become
a
new
pleasure
for
him
after
many
years
as
a
judge
he
developed
the
desire
to
play
executioner
he
wanted
to
kill
in
an
extraordinary
theatrical
way
while
adhering
to
his
own
sense
of
justice
one
day
a
doctor
mentioned
to
wargrave
the
number
of
murders
that
must
go
unpunished
citing
a
recently
deceased
woman
he
felt
sure
was
killed
by
the
married
couple
who
worked
as
her
servants
because
the
couple
withheld
a
needed
drug
in
order
to
kill
her
the
murder
could
never
be
proven
this
story
inspired
wargrave
to
plan
multiple
murders
of
people
who
had
killed
but
could
not
be
prosecuted
under
the
law
he
thought
of
the
“ten
little
indian”
rhyme
that
he
loved
as
a
child
for
its
series
of
inevitable
deaths
wargrave
took
his
time
gathering
a
list
of
victims
bringing
up
the
topic
of
unpunished
murders
in
casual
conversations
and
hoping
someone
would
mention
a
case
of
which
they
knew
wargrave
learned
he
was
terminally
ill
and
decided
to
kill
himself
after
doing
away
with
his
victims
wargrave’s
tenth
victim
we
learn
was
isaac
morris
who
acted
as
his
agent
in
making
the
arrangements
for
indian
island
and
who
had
been
responsible
for
selling
drugs
to
a
young
acquaintance
of
wargrave
who
subsequently
killed
herself
before
leaving
for
indian
island
wargrave
gave
morris
poison
which
he
claimed
was
a
cure
for
morris’s
indigestion
wargrave
killed
marston
and
mrs
rogers
first
he
writes
because
they
bore
the
least
responsibility
for
their
crimes—marston
because
he
was
born
without
a
sense
of
moral
responsibility
and
mrs
rogers
because
she
was
under
the
sway
of
her
husband
when
they
murdered
their
elderly
employer
next
he
killed
general
macarthur
sneaking
up
on
him
near
the
ocean
wargrave
goes
on
to
describe
how
he
tricked
armstrong
into
becoming
his
ally
armstrong
he
notes
“was
a
gullible
sort
of
man



it
was
inconceivable
to
him
that
a
man
of
my
standing
should
actually
be
a
murderer”
he
notes
that
he
killed
mr
rogers
while
the
butler
was
out
chopping
sticks
at
breakfast
he
poisoned
emily
brent
later
armstrong
agreed
to
help
wargrave
fake
his
death
and
pretended
to
examine
the
body
of
the
judge
and
find
a
gunhot
wound
on
his
forehead
wargrave
arranged
to
sneak
out
and
meet
the
armstrong
by
the
shore
that
evening
there
he
pushed
armstrong
over
a
cliff
into
the
ocean
after
armstrong’s
death
wargrave
returned
to
his
room
and
played
dead
killing
blore
was
easy
since
the
expoliceman
foolishly
came
up
to
the
house
alone
and
wargrave
then
watched
with
satisfaction
as
vera
disposed
of
lombard
wargrave
writes
that
he
would
have
killed
vera
himself
but
he
wanted
to
make
her
death
fit
the
rhyme
so
he
set
up
her
room
in
a
suggestive
way
with
a
noose
hanging
down
and
the
smell
of
the
sea
wafting
in
letting
vera’s
own
guilt
drive
her
to
suicide
wargrave
says
he
wrote
the
manuscript
because
he
takes
an
artist’s
pleasure
in
his
own
work
and
wants
recognition
he
wonders
if
the
police
will
pick
up
on
three
clues
first
that
wargrave
was
the
odd
man
out—he
was
not
really
guilty
of
a
murder
as
the
rest
were
since
in
condemning
edward
seton
to
death
he
condemned
a
guilty
man
second
the
line
about
the
“red
herring”
points
to
the
fact
that
armstrong
was
somehow
tricked
into
his
death
third
wargrave’s
death
by
a
bullet
through
the
forehead
will
leave
a
red
mark
like
the
brand
of
cain
the
first
murderer
in
the
biblical
book
of
genesis
wargrave
closes
by
describing
the
mechanism
by
which
he
will
pull
the
trigger
of
the
revolver
from
a
distance
and
have
the
revolver
flung
away
by
an
elastic
band
thereby
shooting
himself
so
that
he
falls
back
on
his
bed
as
though
laid
there
by
the
others
he
concludes
that
men
from
the
mainland
“will
find
ten
dead
bodies
and
an
unsolved
problem
on
indian
island”
analysis
epilogue
the
traditional
detective
story
ends
with
a
scene
in
which
the
sleuth
having
carefully
considered
all
the
evidence
gathers
the
characters
together
and
explains
everything
that
has
happened
concluding
by
unmasking
the
killer
something
similar
takes
place
in
the
epilogue
to
and
then
there
were
none
although
the
police
detectives
are
utterly
baffled
by
what
has
transpired
and
it
is
left
to
another
character
to
explain
things
and
untangle
the
mystery
here
this
other
character
is
wargrave
the
murderer
instead
of
being
investigated
and
solved
by
a
master
detective
the
ten
murders
in
this
novel
can
be
solved
only
by
the
man
who
has
committed
them
the
unorthodox
structure
of
this
plot
begins
to
make
sense
when
we
consider
the
themes
that
christie
has
been
exploring
specifically
the
effects
of
conscience
and
the
administration
of
justice
these
are
classic
detectivefiction
themes
but
christie
gives
them
a
different
spin
by
making
her
murder
victims
guilty
of
other
murders
unpunishable
by
any
legal
means
one
can
argue
that
the
killings
on
indian
island
are
not
crimes
at
all
but
rather
acts
of
ultimate
justice
wargrave
is
not
killing
for
personal
gain
rather
he
is
simply
doing
with
his
own
hands
what
he
did
through
the
agency
of
law
while
he
was
still
a
judge
seen
in
this
light
christie’s
decision
to
have
him
play
the
detective
role
and
explain
the
mystery
to
the
reader
makes
a
certain
kind
of
sense
in
a
traditional
mystery
story
the
detective
is
the
agent
of
justice
stepping
in
when
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
assuring
that
the
murderer
is
duly
punished
in
this
story
wargrave
is
doing
exactly
that
albeit
by
stepping
outside
the
bounds
of
the
law
and
becoming
a
killer
himself
of
course
there
are
objections
to
seeing
wargrave’s
actions
as
just
for
example
one
might
point
out
that
not
all
the
crimes
that
he
punishes
are
really
deliberate
and
premeditated
murders
however
much
we
may
despise
emily
brent
for
instance
she
did
not
actually
kill
her
servant
emily
merely
fired
her
and
the
servant
committed
suicide
similarly
however
appalling
a
human
specimen
tony
marston
may
be
his
running
over
of
two
children
was
accidental
the
same
lack
of
malice
characterizes
dr
armstrong
who
did
not
intend
to
kill
the
woman
who
died
on
his
operating
table
armstrong
and
marston’s
actions
may
have
been
heinous
but
one
could
argue
that
they
don’t
deserve
to
die
christie
goes
out
of
her
way
to
make
us
sympathize
with
wargrave’s
victims
despicable
though
their
actions
may
have
been
wargrave
himself
meanwhile
is
a
markedly
unsympathetic
character
he
presents
himself
as
an
agent
of
justice
but
he
admits
to
experiencing
a
perverse
pleasure
in
the
taking
of
life
beginning
with
the
“various
garden
pests”
that
he
killed
as
a
boy
and
continuing
through
his
human
victims
he
is
just
but
not
at
all
merciful
and
he
kills
with
enthusiastic
cruelty
he
is
also
grandiosely
arrogant
his
conception
of
himself
as
an
“artist”
reduces
his
victims
from
human
beings
to
mere
means
toward
his
selfish
ends
indeed
he
writes
his
confession
only
because
he
cannot
bear
the
idea
that
his
perfect
crime
will
go
unappreciated
at
its
conclusion
christie’s
novel
both
does
and
does
not
reassert
moral
order
wargrave’s
actions
do
not
go
unpunished
he
shares
the
same
fate
as
the
people
he
has
murdered
he
has
become
a
murderer
himself
and
so
under
his
own
code
of
justice
he
cannot
be
allowed
to
live
in
this
regard
christie
returns
to
the
neat
moral
symmetry
of
the
classic
detective
story
the
guilty
receive
what
they
deserve
and
no
one
gets
away
with
murder
at
the
same
time
however
wargrave
would
have
died
of
a
terminal
illness
in
any
case
and
by
killing
himself
he
merely
asserts
authority
over
death
he
arranges
his
death
in
a
way
that
thrills
him
and
dies
a
happy
man
and
a
proud
artist
christie
allows
us
to
feel
the
satisfaction
of
finally
understanding
the
mystery
but
she
does
not
allow
us
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
murderer
sniveling
angrily
led
away
in
handcuffs
or
humiliated
in
front
of
the
world
wargrave
never
loses
his
control
or
his
murderous
sense
of
justice
