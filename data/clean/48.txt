parents
need

know
that
while
the
third
movie
in
pixar's
flagship
toy
story
franchise
is
bound
to
please
moviegoers
of
all
ages
it
is
scarier
and
more
intense
than
the
first
two
(which
is
why
we've
rated
this
threequel
at
a
higher

the
latest
adventure
shared
by
woody
(tom
hanks)
buzz
lightyear
(tim
allen)
and
the
rest
of
andy's
favorite
toys
is
kidfriendly

but
there's
a
fairly
long
scene
of
the
toys
in
serious
peril
toward
the
end
of
the
movie
that
many
3
to
5yearolds
could
find
quite
upsetting
there
are
also
a
few
new
toys
that
act
a
bit
mean
and
creepy
(particularly
a
big
baby
doll
and
a
cymbalclapping
monkey)
and
scenes
in
which
favorite
characters
are
trapped
by
cruel
authority
figures
but
there
are
also
wonderful
touching
messages
about
friendship
loyalty
and
imagination
note
the
3d
version
of
the
movie
may
make
certain
parts
feel
more
immediate/lifelike

the
movie's
intense

what's
the
story?
andy
(voiced
by
john
morris)
is
heading
off
to
college
and
his
mom
(laurie
metcalf)
asks
him
to
clean
out
his
old
stuff
woody
(tom
hanks)
buzz
lightyear
(tim
allen)
and
the
rest
of
andy's
favorite
toys
have
survived
yard
sale
after
yard
sale
but
now
the
best
they
can
hope
for
is
a
oneway
ticket
to
the
attic
after
an
unfortunate
mixup
the
toys

particularly
jessie
(joan
cusack)

believe
it's
for
the
best
if
they
jump
into
the
donation
box
for
sunnyside
daycare
when
they
arrive
they're
greeted
by
a
cuddly
purple
bear
called
lotso
(ned
beatty)
and
ken
(michael
keaton)
who
get
the
gang

including
bullseye
hamm
(john
ratzenberger)
mr
and
mrs
potato
head
(don
rickles
estelle
harris)
slinky
dog
(blake
clarke)
and
rex
(wallace
shawn)

fired
up
to
meet
their
new
little
playmates
but
andy's
toys
quickly
realize
that
these
toddlers
don't
so
much
play
with
toys
as
terrorize
them

and
that
sunnyside
isn't
the
toy
paradise
they
thought
it
was
now
they'll
have
to
use
all
of
their
ingenuity
to
escape
their
preschool
prison
is
it
any
good?
&nbsp
disney's
pixar
is
possibly
the
only
studio
in
the
history
of
hollywood
to
bat
a
thousand
even
though
some
of
their
films
end
up
having
more
adult
appeal
(ratatouille
and
walle
probably
don't
get
as
much
dvd
rotation
as
finding
nemo
or
monsters
inc
in
many
kids'
houses)
than
others
pixar's
films
always
surpass
expectations
so
it's
absolutely
no
surprise
that
the
third
installment
in
the
studio's
toy
story
franchise
is
another
winner
by
now
we
love
these
toys
cheering
them
on
through
battles
with
sid
the
sadistic
tween
neighbor
greedy
big
al
and
selfish
stinky
pete
so
when
andy
tosses
the
toys
in
a
trash
bag
our
hearts
flutter

and
when
that
bag
winds
up
in
the
donation
box
instead
of
a
trash
compactor
we
sigh
in
relief
and
when
at
one
point
it
seems
that
our
beloved
heroes
may
have
truly
reached
the
end
we
tense
up

or
in
the
case
of
the
preschoolers
in
the
audience
shed
a
tear
or
two
(and
if
that
moment
doesn't
get
you
the
scene
in
which
andy's
mom
looks
around
his
empty
room
and
bids
him
farewell
certainly
will)
if
only
every
children's
movie
could
be
this
wellmade
and
wellloved
the
consistency
of
the
voice
cast
(even
andy
is
played
by
the
same
actor
now
in
his
20s)
the
brilliant
animation
and
the
many
running
jokes
are
just
a
few
of
the
reasons
this
series
has
yet
to
go
stale
and
the
clever
new
gags

like
when
buzz
gets
reset
and
ends
up
in
spanish
mode
making
poetic
declarations
of
love
to
his
se&ntildeorita

highlights
the
film's
antagonists

by
beatty's
deceptively
huggable

a
believable
reason
for
acting
so
selfishly
and
keaton's
ken
is
hilariously
clothesobsessed
(and
sensitive
about
being
called
a
girl's
toy)
in
the
end

gets
very
creative
when

the
violence
is
not
a
problem
but
this
movie
does
contain
some
emotionally
mature
situations
that
can
be
disturbing
to
a
more
sensitive
audience
the
reviews
neglect
to
mention
a
very
dark
scene
in
which
a
clown
explains
why
the
teddy
bear
and
other
toys
turned
bad
it
was
an
unexpected
turn
for
a
comedy
and
had
both
the
adults
and
children
raising
eyebrows
and
my
sensitive
6

was
in

i
also

&nbsp
my
three
year
old
and
her
three
year
old
friend
saw
this
together
in
the
theater
and
they
both
loved
it!
they
weren't
scared
during
the
intense
near
death
scenes
maybe
because
we
talked
about
how
this
movie
was
just
pretend
beforehand
or
maybe
it
was
just
because
they
are
only
three
and
don't
understand
the
concept
of
death
yet
the
monkey
and
the
big
baby
were
creepy
even
to
me
but
the
kids
didn't
seem
bothered
and
those
characters
didn't
come
up
in
conversation
later
i
think
the
movie
was
a
little
too
violent
for
small
children
there
were
several
scenes
containing
slapping
and
hitting
and
general
throwing
around
of
others
little
kids
won't
understand
why
some
of
the
characters
are
nice
in
some
scenes
and
mean
and
physically
violent
in
others
it
makes
it
hard
to
tell
who
the
bad
guys
are
also
i
said
there
was
too
much
sexy
stuff
but
that
was
just
because
of
the
the
barbie/ken
scenes
there
are
also
inferences
to
ken
being
gay
because
of
his
love
of
clothes
and
his
personal
grooming
but
i
think
all
of
this
went
over
our
kids
heads
overall
this
was
a
highly
entertaining
movie
that
really
did
appeal
to
the
wide
variety
of
ages
in
the
theater
in
which
we
saw
it
what

i
could
go
on
no
reason
to
expose
children
to
this
movie
which
is
obviously
more
concerned
about
impressing
adults
please
think
carefully
and
perhaps
choose
another
film
to
take
children
to
what
other
families
should
know

perfect
little
movie
but
very
emotional
we
have
four
kids
the
youngest
is
under
two
so
going
to
the
movies
can
be
a
bit
harry
i
find
that
children
under
two
aren't
so
worried
about
movies
being
scary
but
once
you
hit
the
latter
part
of
two
up
into
three
children
start
relating
things
to
their
own
lives
ie
making
connections
this
movie
was
a
bit
emotional
and
intense
and
for
the
most
part
younger
kids
(five
and
younger)
will
either
not
understand
the
emotional
intensity
or
quickly
forget
the
scary
parts
once
the
happily
ever
after
happens
i
personally
loved
this
movie
it
had
everything
the
first
two
did
and
more
i
thought
it
was
sweet
and
sad
and
it
ended
perfectly
i
thought
this
movie
was
by
far
the
best
movie
pixar
has
produced
i
can
see
the
concerns
for
kids
finding
this
movie
too
emotional
i
think
the
best
thing
is
to
know
your
kids
for
example
my
three
year
old
loves
monsters
inc
but
for
awhile
she
didn't
want
her
closet
door
open
at
night
so
just
know
your
kids'
limits
this
movie
is
great
for
everyone
but
just
know
it
has
a
lot
more
drama
and
sadness
in
it
than
most
kids
movies
in
the
end
the
movie
has
great
messages
and
characters
your
kids
will
love
for
years
what
other
families
should
know
too
violent
positive
messages
good
role
models

wait
for
rental
when
you
can
fast
forward
through
some
very
scary
scenes
what
was
disney
thinking?
this
is
toy
story
meets
star
wars
(toys
being
dragged
into
firey
pit)
meets
boogey
nights
(ken
doll
scenes

enough
said)
my
4
year
old
actually
wanted
to
leave
because
he
was
so
scared
yes
it's
entertaining
for
tweens
and
up
but
this
franchise
was
geared
toward
the
preschool
set
the
fact
that
it
got
a
g
rating
is
further
proof
the
rating
system
needs
a
compete
overall
for
those
with
young
children

i
know
there
will
be
pressure
to
take
your
kids
to
see
this
but
if
at
all
possible
try
to
wait
for
video
when
your
kid
will
be
6
months
older
and
you
can
forward
through
some
of
the
scary
parts
that
really
serve
no
purpose
to
the
story
this
just
doesn't
meet
the
age
expectations
for
viewers
that
the
previous
two
movies
set
what
other
families
should
know
too
violent

not
good
for
sensitive
kids
who
still
'believe'
things
are
'real'
very
intense
for
small
children
just
an
fyi
that
we
feel
that
kids
should
be
6
and
up
for
the
new
toy
story
movie
of
course
it's
just
our
experience
with
our
twin
5
year
old
girls
and
8
year
old
son
but
our
2
girls
found
several
parts
of
toy
story
3
too
intense
and
scary
and
even
3
days
later
one
of
them
is
saying
that
it
was
too
scary
and
she
never
ever
ever
wants
to
see
that
movie
again
they
are
now
skeptical
of
all
of
those
toys
shown
in
the
movie
(spoiler
info
below)
basically
the
good
toys
get
involved
with
some
'bad'
toys
at
a
day
care
center
who
not
only
'punish'
the
good
toys
by
locking
them
up
in
cages
(crates)
and
putting
them
'in
the
box
(sandbox)'
for
trying
to
escape
but
the
climax
involves
a
very
intense
scene
of
all
the
good
toys
(woody
buzz
etc)
heading
towards
extermination
in
a
landfill
incinerator
(reminded
us
of
the
fiery
last
scene
in
star
wars
revenge
of
the
sith)
and
the
meanest
toy
is
heartless
and
cruel
throughout
and
even
with
many
chances
to
'change
and
do
the
right
thing'
he
keeps
choosing
to
be
bitter
and
a
villian
if
you
have
a
young
child
who
still
'believes'
in
things
then
this
might
not
be
the
best
choice
we
didn't
even
see
it
in
3d
and
the
effect
would
have
been
even
more
intense
we
loved
the
other
two
toy
story
movies
and
still
watch
them
all
the
time
but
we
were
disappointed
in
the
story
line
for
this
longawaited
movie
it's
as
though
they
made
scary
moments
longer
and
more
dramatic
than
necessary
for
'effect'
beginning
is
fine
end
is
fine
but
the
middle
had
our
girls
crying
and
screaming
many
little
ones
all
around
the
theatre
were
jumping
into
their
parents
laps
and
we
were
all
trying
to
explain
that
is
wasn't
realbut
it
took
almost
20
minutes
for
'everything
to
be
okay'
and
that
was
frustrating
the
movie
is
a
good
pixar
family
movie
but
we
feel
that
people
with
young
kids
5
and
under
may
want
to
not
see
it
on
the
big
screen
what
