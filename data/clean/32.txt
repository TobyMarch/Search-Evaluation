captain
jack
sparrow
(johnny
depp)
returns
to
the
screen
for
another
round
of
supernatural
adventures
on
the
high
seas
in
this
spirited
sequel
to
the
2003
disney
hit
which
reteams
original
director
gore
verbinski
with
original
screenwriters
ted
elliott
and
terry
rossio
as
will
(orlando
bloom)
and
elizabeth
(keira
knightley)
prepare
to
exchange
vows
at
the
altar
their
wedding
plans
hit
rough
waters
with
the
arrival
of
seabound
scallywag
jack
sparrow
it
seems
that
sparrow
owes
a
substantial
blood
debt
to
halfoctopus
sea
captain
davy
jones
(bill
nighy)
and
that
the
only
way
for
the
flamboyant
sea
rover
to
elude
the
wrath
of
his
otherworldly
pursuer
is
to
seek
the
aid
of
mysterious
and
powerful
voodoo
priestess
tia
dalma
(naomie
harris)
whose
ability
to
resurrect
the
dead
and
gaze
into
the
future
may
provide
just
the
advantage
needed
to
avoid
a
waterlogged
fate
in
the
locker
of
his
legendary
nemesis

[this

takes
what
worked

and
redoes
it
only
bigger

in
the

losing
