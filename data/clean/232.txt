when
i
am
lost
you
shine
a
light
for
me
and
set
me
free
when
i
am
low
you
wash
away
my
tears
and
take
me
through
the
loneliness
and
emptiness
through
the
darkest
night
somehow
i
survive
through
it
all
[chorus]
when
you
tell
me
i'm
the
only
one
you
need
sweet
and
tenderly
and
your
love
breaks
away
the
clouds
surrounding
me

i
have
i
want
to
give
to
thee
if
i
should
fall

love
is
strong
enough
to
lift
me
up
if
i'm
afraid
you
chase
away
my
fears
and
take
me
to
a
brighter
place
beyond
the
rain
and
i
feel
alright
'cause
your
by
my
side

it
all
