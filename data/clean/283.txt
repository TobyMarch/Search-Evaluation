the
lord
of
the
rings
book
the
lord
of
the
rings
is
the
greatest
trilogy
and
it
immortalized
the
name
of
its
creator
it
consists
of
three
parts
the
fellowship
of
the
ring
the
two
towers
and
the
return
of
the
king
the
plot
is
based
on
the
struggle
for
the
ring
of
power
which
was
forged
by
sauron
the
dark
lord
long
long
ago
the
trilogy
is
a
logical
sequence
of
a
no
less
famous
fairy
tale
by
tolkien
the
hobbit
as
well
as
the
second
part
of
the
red
book
of
westmarch

the
main
chronicle
of
the
third
age
of
middleearth
the
lord
of
the
rings
belongs
to
the
genre
of
an
epic
has
many
plots
and
a
great
number
of
main
and
secondary
characters
tolkien
had
been
writing
the
lord
of
the
rings
for
more
than
10
years
he
wrote
the
first
chapters
in
1939
after
the
success
of
the
hobbit
the
trilogy
was
published
first
in
19541955
in
his
letter
to
carole
battenphelps
the
writer
affirms
that
he
wrote
the
lord
of
the
rings
for
his
own
pleasure
as
an
attempt
to
create
a
major
work
tolkien
never
thought
that
his
fantasy
adventure
would
become
so
famous
worldwide
the
writer's
friend
cs
lewis
who
wrote
a
review
for
the
first
part
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
didn't
believe
the
book
would
be
a
success
either
however
his
fears
proved
groundless
the
epic
the
lord
of
the
rings
became
a
real
treasure
of
english
literature
of
the
xx
century
all
the
time
critics
find
new
ideas
and
draw
analogies
with
reality
the
lord
of
the
rings
formed
the
basis
of
such
a
literary
genre
as
fantasy

a
branch
of
fiction
which
is
based
on
mythological
and
historical
traditions
with
a
grain
of
magic
it
became
a
socalled
bible
for
other
writers
working
in
this
genre
it
was
very
difficult
to
link
up
a
fairytale
the
hobbit
with
a
largescale
literary
work
addressed
to
a
more
serious
audience
many
characters
appear
as
if
by
themselves
in
the
trilogy
in
a
letter
to
auden
tolkien
stated
that
he
himself
together
with
the
fellowship
of
the
ring
had
gone
all
the
way
up
to
orodruin
we
cannot
help
admiring
tolkien's
careful
elaboration
of
the
history
of
middleearth
there
are
no
unnecessary
or
unimportant
characters
or
geographical
areas
every
character
plays
his/her
role
in
a
complicated
plot
middleearth
can
be
compared
with
a
symmetrical
web
in
the
core
of
which
there
is
the
ring
of
power
there
is
an
image
of
the
spider
in
the
hobbit
as
well
as
in
the
lord
of
the
rings
that
can
be
explained
because
tolkien
was
bitten
by
a
tarantula
once
probably
the
writer
introduced
the
image
of
a
vile
manylegged
being
from
his
personal
experience
tolkien
himself
didn't
like
to
draw
any
parallels
between
his
biography
and
literary
works
and
considered
that
it
could
distract
readers
attention
and
in
no
way
gives
a
better
understanding
of
his
books
however
he
didn't
deny
that
some
biographical
facts
were
reflected
in
his
books
the
world
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
would
have
been
grey
and
empty
without
its
peculiarities
languages
legends
and
history
some
of
the
readers
pay
attention
to
the
plot
and
actions
only
and
skip
interesting
poems
of
the
past
of
middleearth
but
it
is
the
poems
that
link
up

the
lord
of
the
rings
with
the
events
described
in
the
silmarillion
and
the
past
of
middleearth
the
lord
of
the
rings
is
not
only
a
tale
of
enthralling
adventures
and
mythical
beings
but
it
also
touches
upon
some
questions
of
philosophy
and
morality
heroic
deeds
the
unity
for
the
sake
of
a
common
cause
true
love
the
triumph
of
good
over
evil

all
these
could
be
found
in
the
epic
in
the
lord
of
the
rings
there
is
no
direct
indication
as
to
any
religion
however
the
atmosphere
in
the
book
is
literally
pierced
with
holiness
such
places
are
rivendell
and
lorien
which
are
the
strongholds
of
good
in
contrast
mordor
is
an
abode
of
evil
the
readers
as
well
as
the
characters
can
choose
in
what
to
believe
what
to
worship
it
is
wrong
to
say
that
only
fools
have
gathered
under
the
banner
of
evil
the
enemy
is
sly
and
artful
and
only
unity
sincerity
and
kindness
can
subdue
it
the
plot
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
is
very
dynamic
it
seems
that
tolkien
wanted
to
introduce
as
many
geographical
areas
and
livingbeings
as
possible
he
doesn't
stay
too
long
in
one
place
but
leads
the
reader
further
and
further
away
a
great
aim
sets
him
going

the
destruction
of
the
ring
of
power
the
result
of
evil
which
promises
its
owner
riches
and
wealth
in
the
fire
of
orodruin
it
cannot
be
used
for
good
intentions
for
the
artifact
will
try
to
find
a
soft
spot
in
its
owner's
character
and
bring
him/her
under
its
control
a
person
strongwilled
or
completely
indifferent
to
power
can
overcome
all
the
obstacles
and
destroy
the
ring
frodo
and
sam
turn
out
to
be
the
ones
every
new
line
in
the
lord
of
the
rings
arouses
anxiety
for
the
fate
of
middleearth
if
there
were
no
derivations
from
the
main
plot
there
would
have
been
felt
the
heat
thousands
times
greater
than
from
the
fire
of
orodruin
tolkien
fairly
well
understood
that
the
reader
needed
a
break
from
whimsical
languages
of
middleearth
as
well
as
important
events
that
is
why
he
skillfully
introduces
magnificent
descriptions
of
nature
and
the
book
is
abundant
with
many
interesting
dialogues
which
help
to
understand
protagonists
characters
to
the
full
extent
hard
life
in
middleearth
during
the
war
of
the
ring
reflects
hard
life
in
reality
the
war
mixed
all
the
cards
and
those
who
fought
under
wight
banners
yesterday
gave
in
to
the
generous
promises
of
evil
and
vice
verse
vile
and
bitter
enemies
become
allies
as
it
happens
with
gollum
while
battles
take
place
in
gondor
and
rohan
two
little
hobbits
make
their
way
to
orodruin
the
reader
has
to
believe
that
countless
armies
do
not
always
decide
the
outcome
of
the
battle
and
that
one
can
conquer
alone
realism
is
very
important
in
the
trilogy
up
to
the
last
minute
it
is
difficult
to
believe
in
the
traditional
happy
end
frodo
and
sam
can
be
compared
with
ropewalkers
who
balance
over
an
abyss
full
of
sharp
blades
one
step
to
the
side

and
everything
can
perish
in
the
abyss
of
events
the
trilogy
is
undoubtedly
full
of
mythology
in
it
one
can
feel
the
taste
of
a
juicy
fruit
or
coagulated
blood
on
the
lips
even
a
mighty
wizard
gandalf
moves
from
one
place
of
middleearth
to
another
on
a
swift
horse
and
not
by
fairy
teleports
or
magic
spells
reality
like
time
is
eternal
the
struggle
with
different
personifications
of
evil
is
eternal
too
the
war
of
the
ring
is
a
small
part
of
this
struggle
some
critics
compare
sauron
with
hitler
and
mordor
with
nazi
germany
besides
a
part
of
the
epic
was
written
during
wwii
but
evil
has
always
been
and
will
remain
in
middleearth
as
well
as
in
real
life
the
question
is

who
will
be
its
new
followers?
the
lord
of
the
rings
teaches
us
to
be
humane
to
follow
the
principles
of
christianity
sympathy
for
enemies
determines
a
lot
in
the
epic
it
is
both
sympathy
and
humanity
that
prevent
bilbo
from
killing
gollum
who
played
a
crucial
role
in
the
destroying
of
the
ring
good
according
to
tolkien
is
not
revengeful
it
strives
to
get
justice
and
will
never
shoot
an
arrow
into
the
back
of
the
enemy
we
cannot
say
that
everything
ends
extremely
well
thus
elves
leave
middleearth
for
their
power
perishes
with
the
fall
of
the
three
elvish
rings
old
wounds
won't
leave
frodo
in
peace
the
chain
of
evil
has
split
however
there
remains
a
possibility
that
a
new
sauron
will
come
the
lord
of
the
rings
has
become
popular
worldwide
and
has
had
many
editions
and
translations
there
can't
be
a
person
regarding
the
epic
with
utter
indifference
everyone
has
his/her
own
thoughts
and
feelings
towards
the
lord
of
the
rings
it
seems
that
despite
many
critics
analysis
the
lord
of
the
rings
remains
a
poorlylightened
corridor
with
many
entries
and
exits
and
if
someone
is
able
to
make
this
corridor
a
bit
lighter
that
would
be
a
priceless
contribution
