speaking
to
showbiz
411
the
62yearold
actor
let
slip
that
production
is
due
to
start
in
the
autumn
though
she
was
unsure
how
long
the
shoot
might
be
i
just
show
up
she
said
likewise
there
are
no
details
of
release
dates
though
a
number
of
sites
have
speculated
that
the
films
could
be
released
in
consecutive
years
cameron's
producer
jon
landau
has
previously
said
the
first
sequel
may
not
arrive
until
2016
the
filmmaker
himself
revealed
in
may
that
four
movies
are
now
planned
and
has
said
he
is
likely
to
direct
only
avatar
movies
for
the
rest
of
his
career
i'm
in
the
avatar
business
period
that's
it
cameron
told
the
new
york
times
i'm
making
avatar
2
avatar
3
maybe
avatar
4
and
i'm
not
going
to
produce
other
people's
movies
for
them
i'm
not
interested
in
taking
scripts
and
that
all
sounds
i
suppose
a
little
bit
restricted
but
the
point
is
i
think
within
the
avatar
landscape
i
can
say
everything
i
need
to
say
that
i
think
needs
to
be
said
in
terms
of
the
state
of
the
world
and
what
i
think
we
need
to
be
doing
about
it
and
doing
it
in
an
entertaining
way
weaver's
character
in
avatar
chainsmoking
exobiologist
grace
augustine
died
at
the
end
of
the
first
film
but
cameron
has
strongly
hinted
that
she
will
return
nonetheless
don't
worry
i
will
be
back
she
told
comingsoonnet
in
september
jim
says
no
one
ever
dies
in
science
fiction
he's
told
me
the
stories
for
the
next
two
movies
and
i
have
to
say
that
they're
absolutely
wonderful
and
there's
a
real
treat
in
store
now
we
just
have
to
make
them
cameron
has
previously
hinted
that
the
second
film
might
take
place
on
another
planet
in
the
same
solar
system
as
pandora
the
fertile
forest
moon
where
avatar's
action
took
place
he
has
also
mentioned
the
possibility
of
exploring
the
planet's
oceans
the
filmmaker
said
characters
that
survived
the
first
film
get
to
be
in
the
second
film
at
least
in
some
form
released
in
2009
avatar
has
made
a
staggering
$27bn
worldwide
and
currently
stands
as

highest

terminator
ii
he
pinched
the

idea
for
the
terminator
franchise
from
a
scifi
author
without
crediting
himand
he
recycled
the
plot
for

when

made

all
the

is

grumbling

the
trend
for
escapism
grows
and
grows
the
trend
for
sneering
pomposity
is
doing
just
as
well
obviously
the
very
roots
of
cinema
are
grounded
in
escapism
there
is
no
shame
or
blame
in
movies
that
are
purely
escapist
entertainment

sure
you
can't
criticise
anyone
for
watching
crap
anymore
without
being
accused
of
being
elistist
or
pompous
or
whatever

such
a
british
attitude
the
spiral
staircase
to
the
lowest
common
denominator
nothing
wrong
with
escapism
illiteracy
widespread
ignoranceetc
etc
a
lot
of
avatar
fans
would
i'm
sure
be
very
interested
in
the
history
of
cinema

died
at

but
cameron
has
strongly
hinted
that
she
will
return
nonetheless
otherwise
weaver's
statement
i
just
show
up
would
be
rather
pointless
wouldn't
you
agree?

managed

i'm
guessing
from
the
planned
sequels
that
the
aliens
won
in
the
end
or
are
the
sequels
going
to
follow
the
story
of
the
developers
as
they
destroy
the
forests
and
build
cities?
might
be
interesting

we
are

to
go

films
we
deserve
the

what
does
this
even
mean?
seriously
it's
his
money
and
if
he
wants
to
spend
it
all
on
making
more
smurf
films
then
who
cares?
i
still
haven't
seen
the
first
one
but
from
what
i've
heard
cameron
at
least
made
an
effort
to
get
his
films
'right
even
if
they
are
relatively
simplistic
action/adventure
blockbusters

side

i
also
like
to
pretend
that
only
three
movies
were
ever
made
and
that
they
shot
a
pretty
good
fight
scene
for
a
potential
fourth
movie
but
then
production
shut
down
and
the
rest
of
the

was
never

it
would

perhaps
we
could
start
by
removing
the
apalling
racism
from
everyday
life
then
maybe
we
could
start
worrying
about
the
racism

@alephfool
don't
be
confused
alephfool
it
is
actually
simple
having
seen
the
(awful)
film
i
for
one
was
stumped
as
to
what
the
justification
could
possibly
be
not
just
for
a
sequel
but
for
three
more
of
these
so
i
read
the
article
then
having
an
opinion
about
the
matter
i
posted
your
post
on
the
other
hand
didn't
leave
me
the
slightest
bit
surprised
in
terms
of
'human
nature'
one
can
always
rely
on
at
least
one
person
to
come
in
and
posture
as
if
they
and
the
sparkling
clarity
of
their
superior
immaculately
logical
minds
are
above
it
alli
mean
you
in
case
you
are
confused
again

au
contraire
you
can
criticize
whatever
you
like
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
it's
the
quality
of
your
criticism
not
its
topic
that
i'm
debating
similarly
accusing
someone
of
elitism
is
not
a
particularly
british
attitude
in
fact
i'd
say
its
origins
are
found
in
american
cultural
criticism
the
british
being
perceived
as
a
bunch
of
effete
elitist
milquetoasts
and
all
that
again
i'd
point
out
that
you
think
escapism
is
by
definition
a
bad
thing
to
be
lumped
in
with
illiteracy
widespread
ignoranceetc
etc
however
i
believe
escapism
is
a
perfectly
acceptable
and
even
sometimes
commendable
attitude
especially
in
the
context
of
mainstream
hollywood
entertainment
finally
what
makes
you
think
a
lot
of
avatar
fans
aren't
familiar
with
the
history
of
cinema?
could
it
be
your
obnoxious
and
misplaced
sense
of
cultural
superiority?
