song

yesterday
shishya
&nbsp“out
of
balance”
&nbsp
it's
long
time
due
and
it's
high
time
i
knew
the
wherefore’s
and
the
why's
of
my
lows
and
highs
i
am
a
man
out
of
balance
the
equilibrium
has
been
in
decay
the
trace
of
perspective
i
inherited
from
my
parents
wasted
away&nbsp
i
suffer
from
both
irrational
exuberance
and
illogical
caution
and
restraint
like
a
newly
painted
wall
not
sure
which
sign
i
should
put
up
dryor&nbspwet
paint?
we
all
have
fulcrums
that
we
rest
on
but
some
seesaws
come
down
…while
others
rise
my
seesaw
suffers
from
both
now
isn’t
that
a
surprise!!!&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp
learn
about
balance
dear
heart
how
long
will
you
last?
&nbspsome
sails
need
rest
some
need
tying
to
the
mast
&nbsp
&nbsp
enjoy

birri
yesterday
shishya
&nbspmy
father
left
me
his
house
i
sold
it
within
days
to
get
some
cash
blood
sweat
and
tears
sold
as
trash
he
struggled
all
his
life
so
i
can
have
my
day
what
took
him
a
lifetime
to
build
i
threw
it
away
in
less
than
a
day
maybe
i
should
how
things
are
built
and
long
they
can
take…
some
spirits
go
on
all
the
way
some
easily
break
my
father
was
a
quiet
man
had
only
one
dream
in
his
soul
and
heart
unassuming
in
many
ways
if
he
could
see
me
nowhe'd
come
apart
watching
how
i
threw
awaymy
fathers
dream…to
give
his
children
a
head
start
i
loved
my
father
and
yet
i
have
done
what
i
have
done
at
what
point
in
my
life
did
fibres
and
stitches
become
undone
i
thought
i
was
made
from
fibre
and
foundations
honest
and
rare
which
brick
and
stone
left
me
in
disrepair?
i
seem
to
have
forgotten
most
of
my
prayers
maybe
there
are
no
bricks
or
stones
that
i
should
blame
perhaps
it
all
started
when
i
choose
the
easy
way
and
started
playing
games
i
tend
to
blame
others
when
the
buck
should
stop
here
i
have
blamed
many
along
the
way
but
really
there
are
a
few
crocks
in
my
tears
be
honest
dear
heart
you’ve
sold
it
all
to
raise
some
easy
cash
selling
blood
sweat
and
tears
&nbspas
trash
how
deserving
a
man
am
i
having
no
regard
for
how
it
was&nbspall
built
maybe
i
should
knowit's
not
showing
in&nbspmy
eye
not
a
trace
of
shame
or
guilt
