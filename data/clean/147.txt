an
assembly
of
god
church
where
he
found
his
initial
musical
inspiration[6]

was
primarily
a
western
european
mix
on
his
mother's
side
he
was
scotsirish
with
some
french
norman
one
of
gladys's
greatgreatgrandmothers
was

his
father's
forebears
were
of

was
regarded
by
relatives
and
friends
as
the
dominant
member
of
the
small
family
vernon
moved
from
one
odd
job
to
the
next
evidencing
little
ambition[10][11]
the

from
neighbors
and
government

entered
first
grade

consolidated
where
his
instructors
regarded
him
as
average[13]

his
schoolteacher
with
a
rendition
of
red

old

the
tenyearold

stood
on
a
chair
to
reach
the
microphone
and
sang
old
shep
he
recalled
placing
fifth[14]
a
few
months
later
presley
received
his
first
guitar
for
his
birthday
he
had
hoped
for
something
else—by
different
accounts
either
a
bicycle
or
a
rifle[15][16]
over
the
following
year
he
received
basic
guitar
lessons
from
two
of
his
uncles
and
the
new
pastor
at
the
family's
church
presley
recalled
i
took
the
guitar
and
i
watched
people
and
i
learned
to
play
a
little
bit
but
i
would
never
sing
in
public
i
was
very
shy
about
it[17]
entering
a
new
school
milam
for
sixth
grade
in
september
1946
presley
was
regarded
as
a
loner
the
following
year
he
began
bringing
his
guitar
in
on
a
daily
basis
he
played
and
sang
during
lunchtime
and
was
often
teased
as
a
trashy
kid
who
played
hillbilly
music
the
family
was
by
then
living
in
a
largely
africanamerican
neighborhood[18]
a
devotee
of
mississippi
slim's
show
on
the
tupelo
radio
station
welo
presley
was
described
as
crazy
about
music
by
slim's
younger
brother
a
classmate
of
presley's
who
often
took
him
in
to
the
station
slim
supplemented
presley's
guitar
tuition
by
demonstrating
chord
techniques[19]
when
his
prot&eacuteg&eacute
was
12
years
old
slim
scheduled
him
for
two
onair
performances
presley
was
overcome
by
stage
fright
the
first
time
but
succeeded
in
performing
the
following
week[20]
teenage
life
in
memphis
in
november
1948
the
family
moved
to
memphis
tennessee
after
residing
for
nearly
a
year
in
rooming
houses
they
were
granted
a
twobedroom
apartment
in
the
public
housing
complex
known
as
the
courts[21]
enrolled
at
humes
high
school
presley
received
only
a
c
in
music
in
eighth
grade
when
his
music
teacher
told
him
he
had
no
aptitude
for
singing
he
brought
in
his
guitar
the
next
day
and
sang
a
recent
hit
keep
them
cold
icy
fingers
off
me
in
an
effort
to
prove
otherwise
a
classmate
later
recalled
that
the
teacher
agreed
that
elvis
was
right
when
he
said
that
she
didn't
appreciate
his
kind
of
singing[22]
he
was
generally
too
shy
to
perform
openly
and
was
occasionally
bullied
by
classmates
who
viewed
him
as
a
mama's
boy[23]
in
1950
he
began
practicing
guitar
regularly
under
the
tutelage
of
jesse
lee
denson
a
neighbor
twoandahalf
years
his
senior
they
and
three
other
boys—including
two
future
rockabilly
pioneers
brothers
dorsey
and
johnny
burnette—formed
a
loose
musical
collective
that
played
frequently
around
the
courts[24]
that
september
he
began
ushering
at
loew's
state
theater[25]
other
jobs
followed
during
his
school
years
precision
tool
loew's
again
and
marl
metal
products[26]
during
his
junior
year
presley
began
to
stand
out
more
among
his
classmates
largely
because
of
his
appearance
he
grew
out
his
sideburns
and
styled
his
hair
with
rose
oil
and
vaseline
on
his
own
time
he
would
head
down
to
beale
street
the
heart
of
memphis's
thriving
blues
scene
and
gaze
longingly
at
the
wild
flashy
clothes
in
the
windows
of
lansky
brothers
by
his
senior
year
he
was
wearing
them[27]
overcoming
his
reticence
about
performing
outside
the
courts
he
competed
in
humes's
annual
minstrel
show
in
april
1953
singing
and
playing
guitar
he
opened
with
till
i
waltz
again
with
you
a
recent
hit
for
teresa
brewer
presley
recalled
that
the
performance
did
much
for
his
reputation
i
wasn't
popular
in
school

i
failed
music—only
thing
i
ever
failed
and
then
they
entered
me
in
this
talent
show

when
i
came
onstage
i
heard
people
kind
of
rumbling
and
whispering
and
so
forth
'cause
nobody
knew
i
even
sang
it
was
amazing
how
popular
i
became
after
that[28]
presley
who
never
received
formal
music
training
or
learned
to
read
music
studied
and
played
by
ear
he
frequented
record
stores
with
jukeboxes
and
listening
booths
he
knew
all
of
hank
snow's
songs[29]
and
he
loved
records
by
other
country
singers
such
as
roy
acuff
ernest
tubb
ted
daffan
jimmie
rodgers
jimmie
davis
and
bob
wills[30]
the
southern
gospel
singer
jake
hess
one
of
his
favorite
performers
was
a
significant
influence
on
his
balladsinging
style[31][32]
he
was
a
regular
audience
member
at
the
monthly
allnight
singings
downtown
where
many
of
the
white
gospel
groups
that
performed
reflected
the
influence
of
africanamerican
spiritual
music[33]
he
adored
the
music
of
black
gospel
singer
sister
rosetta
tharpe[30]
like
some
of
his
peers
he
may
have
attended
blues
venues—of
necessity
in
the
segregated
south
only
on
nights
designated
for
exclusively
white
audiences[34]
he
certainly
listened
to
the
regional
radio
stations
that
played
race
records
spirituals
blues
and
the
modern
backbeatheavy
sound
of
rhythm
and
blues[35]
many
of
his
future
recordings
were
inspired
by
local
africanamerican
musicians
such
as
arthur
crudup
and
rufus
thomas[36][37]
bb
king
recalled
that
he
knew
presley
before
he
was
popular
when
they
both
used
to
frequent
beale
street[38]
by
the
time
he
graduated
from
high
school
in
june
1953
presley
had
already
singled
out
music
as
his
future[39][40]

presley's
sun
recordings
in
august
1953
presley
walked
into
the
offices
of
sun
records
he
aimed
to
pay
for
a
few
minutes
of
studio
time
to
record
a
twosided
acetate
disc
my
happiness
and
that's
when
your
heartaches
begin
he
would
later
claim
he
intended
the
record
as
a
gift
for
his
mother
or
was
merely
interested
in
what
he
sounded
like
though
there
was
a
much
cheaper
amateur
recordmaking
service
at
a
nearby
general
store
biographer
peter
guralnick
argues
that
he
chose
sun
in
the
hope
of
being
discovered
asked
by
receptionist
marion
keisker
what
kind
of
singer
he
was
presley
responded
i
sing
all
kinds
when
she
pressed
him
on
whom
he
sounded
like
he
repeatedly
answered
i
don't
sound
like
nobody
after
he
recorded
sun
boss
sam
phillips
asked
keisker
to
note
down
the
young
man's
name
which
she
did
along
with
her
own
commentary
good

hold[41]
presley
cut
a
second
acetate
in
january
1954—i'll
never
stand
in
your
way
and
it
wouldn't
be
the
same
without
you—but
again
nothing
came
of
it[42]
not
long
after
he
failed
an
audition
for
a
local
vocal
quartet
the
songfellows
he
explained
to
his
father
they
told
me
i
couldn't
sing[43]
songfellow
jim
hamill
later
claimed
that
he
was
turned
down
because
he
did
not
demonstrate
an
ear
for
harmony
at
the
time[44]
in
april
presley
began
working
for
the
crown
electric
company
as
a
truck
driver[45]
his
friend
ronnie
smith
after
playing
a
few
local
gigs
with
him
suggested
he
contact
eddie
bond
leader
of
smith's
professional
band
which
had
an
opening
for
a
vocalist
bond
rejected
him
after
a
tryout
advising
presley
to
stick
to
truck
driving
because
you're
never
going
to
make
it
as
a
singer[46]
phillips
meanwhile
was
always
on
the
lookout
for
someone
who
could
bring
to
a
broader
audience
the
sound
of
the
black
musicians
on
whom
sun
focused
as
keisker
reported
over
and
over
i
remember
sam
saying
'if
i
could
find
a
white
man
who
had
the
negro
sound
and
the
negro
feel
i
could
make
a
billion
dollars'[47]
in
june
he
acquired
a
demo
recording
of
a
ballad
without
you
that
he
thought
might
suit
the
teenaged
singer
presley
came
by
the
studio
but
was
unable
to
do
it
justice
despite
this
phillips
asked
presley
to
sing
as
many
numbers
as
he
knew
he
was
sufficiently
affected
by
what
he
heard
to
invite
two
local
musicians
guitarist
winfield
scotty
moore
and
upright
bass
player
bill
black
to
work
something
up
with
presley
for
a
recording
session[48]
that's
all
right
noicon
presley
transformed
not
only
the
sound
but
the
emotion
of
the
song
turning
what
had
been
written
as
a
lament
for
a
lost
love
into
a
satisfied
declaration
of
independence[49]

the
session
held
the
evening
of
july
5
proved
entirely
unfruitful
until
late
in
the
night
as
they
were
about
to
give
up
and
go
home
presley
took
his
guitar
and
launched
into
a
1946
blues
number
arthur
crudup's
that's
all
right
moore
recalled
all
of
a
sudden
elvis
just
started
singing
this
song
jumping
around
and
acting
the
fool
and
then
bill
picked
up
his
bass
and
he
started
acting
the
fool
too
and
i
started
playing
with
them
sam
i
think
had
the
door
to
the
control
booth
open

he
stuck
his
head
out
and
said
'what
are
you
doing?'
and
we
said
'we
don't
know'
'well
back
up'
he
said
'try
to
find
a
place
to
start
and
do
it
again'
phillips
quickly
began
taping
this
was
the
sound
he
had
been
looking
for[50]

days
later
popular
memphis

dewey
phillips
played
that's
all
right
on
his
red
hot
and
blue
show[51]
listeners
began
phoning
in
eager
to
find
out
who
the
singer
was
the
interest
was
such
that
phillips
played
the
record
repeatedly
during
the
last
two
hours
of
his
show
interviewing
presley
onair
phillips
asked
him
what
high
school
he
attended
in
order
to
clarify
his
color
for
the
many
callers
who
had
assumed
he
was
black[52]
during
the
next
few
days
the
trio
recorded
a
bluegrass
number
bill
monroe's

again
in
a
distinctive
style
and
employing
a
juryrigged

dubbed

early
live
performances
and
signing
to
rca
the
trio
played
publicly
for
the
first
time
on
july
17
at
the
bon
air
club—presley
still
sporting
his
childsize
guitar[54]
at
the
end
of
the
month
they
appeared
at
the
overton
park
shell
with
slim
whitman
headlining
a
combination
of
his
strong
response
to
rhythm
and
nervousness
at
playing
before
a
large
crowd
led
presley
to
shake
his
legs
as
he
performed
his
widecut
pants
emphasized
his
movements
causing
young
women
in
the
audience
to
start
screaming[55]
moore
recalled
during
the
instrumental
parts
he
would
back
off
from
the
mike
and
be
playing
and
shaking
and
the
crowd
would
just
go
wild[56]
black
a
natural
showman
whooped
and
rode
his
bass
hitting
double
licks
that
presley
would
later
remember
as
really
a
wild
sound
like
a
jungle
drum
or
something[56]
soon
after
moore
and
black
quit
their
old
band
to
play
with
presley
regularly
and
dj
and
promoter
bob
neal
became
the
trio's
manager
from
august
through
october
they
played
frequently
at
the
eagle's
nest
club
and
returned
to
sun
studio
for
more
recording
sessions[57]
and
presley
quickly
grew
more
confident
on
stage
according
to
moore
his
movement
was
a
natural
thing
but
he
was
also
very
conscious
of
what
got
a
reaction
he'd
do
something
one
time
and
then
he
would
expand
on
it
real
quick[58]
presley
made
what
would
be
his
only
appearance
on
nashville's
grand
ole
opry
on
october
2
after
a
polite
audience
response
opry
manager
jim
denny
told
phillips
that
his
singer
was
not
bad
but
did
not
suit
the
program[59]
two
weeks
later
presley
was
booked
on
louisiana
hayride
the
opry's
chief
and
more
adventurous
rival
the
shreveportbased
show
was
broadcast
to
198
radio
stations
in
28
states
presley
had
another
attack
of
nerves
during
the
first
set
which
drew
a
muted
reaction
a
more
composed
and
energetic
second
set
inspired
an
enthusiastic
response[60]
house
drummer
dj
fontana
brought
a
new
element
complementing
presley's
movements
with
accented
beats
that
he
had
mastered
playing
in
strip
clubs[61]
soon
after
the
show
the
hayride
engaged
presley
for
a
year's
worth
of
saturdaynight
appearances
trading
in
his
old
guitar
for
$8
(and
seeing
it
promptly
dispatched
to
the
garbage)
he
purchased
a
martin
instrument
for
$175
and
his
trio
began
playing
in
new
locales
including
houston
texas
and
texarkana
arkansas[62]
by
early
1955
presley's
regular
hayride
appearances
constant
touring
and
wellreceived
record
releases
had
made
him
a
substantial
regional
star
from
tennessee
to
west
texas
in
january
neal
signed
a
formal
management
contract
with
presley
and
brought
the
singer
to
the
attention
of
colonel
tom
parker
whom
he
considered
the
best
promoter
in
the
music
business
parker—dutchborn
though
he
claimed
to
be
from
west
virginia—had
acquired
an
honorary
colonel's
commission
from
country
singer
turned
louisiana
governor
jimmie
davis
having
successfully
managed
top
country
star
eddy
arnold
he
was
now
working
with
the
new
numberone
country
singer
hank
snow
parker
booked
presley
on
snow's
february
tour[63][64]
when
the
tour
reached
odessa
texas
a
19yearold
roy
orbison
saw
presley
for
the
first
time
his
energy
was
incredible
his
instinct
was
just
amazing

i
just
didn't
know
what
to
make
of
it
there
was
just
no
reference
point
in
the
culture
to
compare
it[29]
presley
made
his
television
debut
on
march
3
on
the
kslatv
broadcast
of
louisiana
hayride
soon
after
he
failed
an
audition
for
arthur
godfrey's
talent
scouts
on
the
cbs
television
network
by
august
sun
had
released
ten
sides
credited
to
elvis
presley
scotty
and
bill
on
the
latest
recordings
the
trio
were
joined
by
a
drummer
some
of
the
songs
like
that's
all
right
were
in
what
one
memphis
journalist
described
as
the
rb
idiom
of
negro
field
jazz
others
like
blue
moon
of
kentucky
were
more
in
the
country
field
but
there
was
a
curious
blending
of
the
two
different
musics
in
both[65]
this
blend
of
styles
made
it
difficult
for
presley's
music
to
find
radio
airplay
according
to
neal
many
countrymusic
disc
jockeys
would
not
play
it
because
he
sounded
too
much
like
a
black
artist
and
none
of
the
rhythmandblues
stations
would
touch
him
because
he
sounded
too
much
like
a
hillbilly[66]
the
blend
came
to
be
known
as
rockabilly
at
the
time
presley
was
variously
billed
as
the
king
of
western
bop
the
hillbilly
cat
and
the
memphis
flash[67]
presley
renewed
neal's
management
contract
in
august
1955
simultaneously
appointing
parker
as
his
special
adviser[68]
the
group
maintained
an
extensive
touring
schedule
throughout
the
second
half
of
the
year[69]
neal
recalled
it
was
almost
frightening
the
reaction
that
came
to
elvis
from
the
teenaged
boys
so
many
of
them
through
some
sort
of
jealousy
would
practically
hate
him
there
were
occasions
in
some
towns
in
texas
when
we'd
have
to
be
sure
to
have
a
police
guard
because
somebody'd
always
try
to
take
a
crack
at
him
they'd
get
a
gang
and
try
to
waylay
him
or
something[70]
the
trio
became
a
quartet
when
hayride
drummer
fontana
joined
as
a
full
member
in
midoctober
they
played
a
few
shows
in
support
of
bill
haley
whose
rock
around
the
clock
had
been
a
numberone
hit
the
previous
year
haley
observed
that
presley
had
a
natural
feel
for
rhythm
and
advised
him
to
sing
fewer
ballads[71]
at
the
country
disc
jockey
convention
in
early
november
presley
was
voted
the
year's
most
promising
male
artist[72]
several
record
companies
had
by
now
shown
interest
in
signing
him
after
three
major
labels
made
offers
of
up
to
$25000
parker
and
phillips
struck
a
deal
with
rca
victor
on
november
21
to
acquire
presley's
sun
contract
for
an
unprecedented
$40000[73]c
presley
at
20
was
still
a
minor
so
his
father
signed
the
contract[74]
parker
arranged
with
the
owners
of

jean

began

residency
at

hotel

casino
on

amid

presley
who
had
serious
acting

signed

he
began
a

of
the

message
on

of

local
catholic
diocese's

was
sent

it
warned
that
presley
is
a
definite
danger
to
the
security
of
the
united
states

[his]
actions
and
motions
were
such
as
to
rouse
the
sexual
passions
of
teenaged
youth

after
the
show
more
than
1000
teenagers
tried
to
gang
into
presley's
room
at
the
auditorium

indications
of
the
harm
presley
did
just
in

were
the
two
high
school
girls

whose
abdomen
and
thigh
had
presley's
autograph[91]

during
the
performance
presley
abruptly
halted
an
uptempo
rendition
of

of
his
arm
and
launched
into
a
slow
grinding
version
accentuated
with
energetic
exaggerated
body
movements[92]
presley's
gyrations
created
a
storm
of
controversy[93]
television
critics
were
outraged
jack
gould
of
the
new
york
times
wrote
mr
presley
has
no
discernible
singing
ability

his
phrasing
if
it
can
be
called
that
consists
of
the
stereotyped
variations
that
go
with
a
beginner's
aria
in
a
bathtub

his
one
specialty
is
an
accented
movement
of
the
body

primarily
identified
with
the
repertoire
of
the
blond
bombshells
of
the
burlesque
runway[94]
ben
gross
of
the
new

news
opined
that
popular
music
has
reached
its
lowest
depths
in
the
'grunt

antics
of
one
elvis
presley

elvis
who
rotates
his

gave
an
exhibition
that

ed

soon
found
himself
being
referred
to
as

called

most
childish
expressions

comin'
from

first

as
described
by

allen
thought
presley
was
talentless
and
absurd
[he]
set
things
up
so
that
presley
would
show
his
contrition[98]
allen
for
his
part
later
wrote
that
he
found
presley's
strange
gangly
countryboy
charisma
his
hardtodefine
cuteness
and
his
charming
eccentricity
intriguing
and
simply
worked
the
singer
into
the
customary
comedy
fabric
of
his
program[99]
presley
would
refer
back
to
the

show
as
the
most
ridiculous
performance
of
his
career[100]

then
accompanied

announced
that

he
did
not

to
be
treated
any
differently

he
had
met

firmly

that[136]

presley
was
devastated[137]
their
relationship
had
remained
extremely
close—even
into
his
adulthood
they
would
use
baby
talk
with
each
other
and
presley
would
address
her
with
pet
names[138]
after
training
presley
joined
the
3rd
armored
division
in
friedberg
germany
on
october
1[139]
introduced
to
amphetamines
by
a
sergeant
while
on
maneuvers
he
became
practically
evangelical
about
their
benefits—not
only
for
energy
but
for
strength
and
weight
loss
as
well—and
many
of
his
friends
in
the
outfit
joined
him
in
indulging[140]
the
army
also
introduced
presley
to
karate
which
he
studied
seriously
later
including
it
in
his
live
performances[141]
fellow
soldiers
have
attested
to
presley's
wish
to
be
seen
as
an
able
ordinary
soldier
despite
his
fame
and
to
his
generosity
he
donated
his
army
pay
to
charity
purchased
tv
sets
for
the
base
and
bought
an
extra
set
of
fatigues
for
everyone
in

would
eventually
marry
after
a

courtship[143]
in
her
autobiography
priscilla
says
that
despite
his
worries
that
it
would
ruin
his
career
parker
convinced
presley
that
to
gain
popular
respect
he
should
serve
his
country
as
a
regular
soldier
rather
than
in
special
services
where
he
would
have
been
able
to
give
some
musical
performances

of

filmography
parker
had
by
now
pushed
presley
into
a
heavy
moviemaking
schedule
focused
on
formulaic
modestly
budgeted
musical
comedies
presley
at
first
insisted
on
pursuing
more
serious
roles
but
when
two
films
in
a
more
dramatic
vein—flaming
star
(1960)
and
wild
in
the
country
(1961)—were
less
commercially
successful
he
reverted
to
the
formula
among
the
27
movies
he
made
during
the
1960s
there
were
few
further
exceptions[159]
his
films
were
almost
universally
panned
one
critic
dismissed
them
as
a
pantheon
of
bad
taste[160]
nonetheless
they
were
virtually
all
profitable
hal

nine
of
them
declared
a

picture
is
the
only
sure
thing
in

eps
the
movies'
rapid
production
and
release
schedules—he
frequently
starred
in
three
a
year—affected
his
music
according
to
jerry
leiber
the
soundtrack
formula
was
already
evident
before
presley
left
for
the
army
three
ballads
one
mediumtempo

one
uptempo
and
one
break
blues

as
the
decade
wore

quality
of

soundtrack
songs
grew
progressively
worse[163]
julie
parrish
who
appeared
in
paradise
hawaiian
style
(1966)
says
that
he
hated
many
of
the
songs
chosen
for
his
films[164]
the
jordanaires'
gordon
stoker
describes
how
presley
would
retreat
from
the
studio
microphone
the
material
was
so
bad
that
he
felt
like
he
couldn't
sing
it[165]
most
of
the
movie
albums
featured
a
song
or
two
from
respected
writers
such
as
the
team
of
doc
pomus
and
mort
shuman
but
by
and
large
according
to
biographer
jerry
hopkins
the
numbers
seemed
to
be
written
on
order
by
men
who
never
really
understood
elvis
or
rock
and
roll[166]
regardless
of
the
songs'
quality
it
has
been
argued
that
presley
generally
sang
them
well
with
commitment[167]
critic
dave
marsh
heard
the
opposite
presley
isn't
trying
probably
the
wisest
course
in
the
face
of
material
like
'no
room
to
rumba
in
a
sports
car'
and
'rockahula
baby'[114]
in
the
first
half
of
the
decade
three
of
presley's
soundtrack
albums
hit
number
one
on
the
pop
charts
and
a
few
of
his
most
popular
songs
came
from
his
films
such
as
can't
help
falling
in

(1961)
and

but
as
with

merit
the

steadily
diminished

his

described

was
arguably
the
greatest
white
gospel
singer
of

on

1970
presley
engineered
a
meeting
with
president
richard
nixon
at
the
white
house
where
he
expressed
his
patriotism
and
his
contempt
for
the
hippie
drug
culture
he
asked
nixon
for
a
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs
badge
to
add
to
similar
items
he
had
begun
collecting
and
to
signify
official
sanction
of
his
patriotic
efforts
nixon
who
apparently
found
the
encounter
awkward
expressed
a
belief
that
presley
could
send
a
positive
message
to
young
people
and
that
it
was
therefore
important
he
retain
his
credibility
presley
told
nixon
that
the
beatles
whose
songs
he
regularly
performed
in
concert
during
the
era[199]
exemplified
what
he
saw
as
a
trend
of
antiamericanism
and
drug
abuse
in
popular
culture[200]
(presley
and
his
friends
had
had
a
fourhour
gettogether
with
the
beatles
five
years
earlier)
on
hearing
reports
of
the
meeting
paul
mccartney
later
said
that
he
felt
a
bit
betrayed

the
great
joke
was
that

on

according
to
joe
moscheo
of
the

the
failure
of
presley's

was
a
blow
from
which
he
never
recovered[213]

presley
performed

presley's
costume
became
the
most
recognized
example
of
the
elaborate
concert
garb
with
which
his
latterday
persona
became
closely
associated
as
described
by
bobbie
ann
mason
at
the
end
of

he
spreads
out

four

rushed
onto
the
stage
in

attack
security
men
leapt
to
presley's
defense
and
the
singer's
karate
instinct
took
over
as
he
ejected
one
invader
from
the
stage
himself
following
the
show
he
became
obsessed
with
the
idea
that
the
men
had
been
sent
by
mike
stone
to
kill
him
though
they
were
shown
to
have
been
only

him

large
doses
of
medication
after

two
full
days
of
raging

his
friend
and

felt
compelled
to
get
a
price
for

and

fell
out
of
the

to
his
knees
people
jumped
to
help
and
he
pushed
them
away
like
'don't
help
me'
he
walked
on

and
held
onto
the
mike
for
the
first
thirty
minutes
like
it
was
a
post
everybody's
looking
at

like
is

gonna
happen?[224]
guitarist
john
wilkinson
recalled
he
was
all
gut
he
was
slurring
he
was
so
fucked
up

it
was
obvious
he
was
drugged
it
was
obvious
there
was
something
terribly
wrong
with
his
body
it
was
so
bad
the
words
to
the
songs
were
barely
intelligible

i
remember
crying
he
could
barely
get
through
the
introductions[225]
wilkinson
recounted
that
a
few
nights
later
in
detroit
i
watched
him
in
his
dressing
room
just
draped
over
a
chair
unable
to
move
so
often
i
thought
'boss
why
don't
you
just
cancel
this
tour
and
take
a
year
off?'
i
mentioned
something
once
in
a
guarded
moment
he
patted
me
on
the
back
and
said
'it'll
be
all
right
don't
you
worry
about
it'[225]
presley
continued
to
play
to
sellout
crowds
as
cultural
critic
marjorie
garber
describes
he
was
now
widely
seen
as
a
garish
pop
crooner
in
effect
he
had
become
liberace
even
his
fans
were
now
middleaged
matrons
and
bluehaired
grandmothers[226]
on

vernon
presley—who
had
become
deeply
involved
in
his
son's
financial
affairs—fired
memphis
mafia
bodyguards
red
west
(presley's
friend
since
the
1950s)
sonny
west
and
david
hebler
citing
the
need
to
cut
back
on
expenses[227][228][229]
presley
was
in
palm
springs
at
the
time
and
some
suggest
the
singer
was
too
cowardly
to
face
the
three
himself
another
associate
of
presley's
john
o'grady
argued
that
the
bodyguards
were
dropped
because
their
rough
treatment
of
fans
had
prompted
too
many
lawsuits[230]
however
presley's
stepbrother
david
stanley
has
claimed
that
the
bodyguards
were
fired
because
they
were
becoming
more
outspoken
about
presley's
drug
dependency[231]
presley
and
linda
thompson
split
in
november
and
he
took
up
with
a
new
girlfriend
ginger
alden[232]
he
proposed
to
alden
and
gave
her
an
engagement
ring
two
months
later
though
several
of
his
friends
later
claimed
that
he
had
no
serious
intention
of
marrying
again[233]
rca
which
had
enjoyed
a
steady
stream
of
product
from
presley
for
over
a
decade
grew
anxious
as
his
interest
in
spending
time
in
the
studio
waned
after
a
december
1973
session
that
produced
18
songs
enough
for
almost
two
albums
he
did
not
enter
the
studio
in
1974[234]

competitive
grammy
award[236]
(all
three
of
his
competitive
grammy
wins—out
of
14
total

presley
returned

parker's
attempts
to
arrange

in

rca
sent

made
possible
two
fullscale

sessions
at

the
story
was

was

hugely
overweight

the
singer
was
on

for
less
than
an
hour
and
was
impossible
to

presley
failed
to
appear
in

he
was
unable
to
get
out
of
his
hotel

and
the
rest
of
the

was
cancelled[246]
despite
the
accelerating
deterioration
of
his
health
he
stuck
to
most
touring
commitments
in
rapid
city
south
dakota
he
was
so
nervous
on
stage
that
he
could
hardly
talk
according
to
presley
historian
samuel
roy
and
unable
to
perform
any
significant
movement[247]
guralnick
relates
that
fans
were
becoming
increasingly
voluble
about
their

it
all
seemed
to
go

world
was
now
confined
almost
entirely
to
his

his
spiritualism

of

critic
henry

observes
that
elvis

as
a

and
a
tenor
an
extraordinary
compass

and
a
very
wide
range
of

have
something
to
do
with
this
divergence
of
opinion[303]
he
identifies
presley
as
a

calculating
his
range
as
two
octaves
and
a
third
from
the
baritone

to
the

upward
extension

is
in

to

granting
an
extra
full
step
up
or
down[303]
in
pleasants'
view
his
voice
was
variable
and
unpredictable
at
the
bottom
often
brilliant
at
the
top
with
the
capacity
for
fullvoiced
high
gs
and
as
that
an

might
envy[303]
scholar
lindsay
waters
who
figures
presley's
range
as
two
and
a
quarter
octaves
emphasizes
that
his
voice
had
an
emotional
range
from
tender
whispers
to
sighs
down
to
shouts
grunts
grumbles
and
sheer
gruffness
that
could
move
the
listener
from
calmness
and
surrender
to
fear
his
voice
can
not
be
measured
in
octaves
but
in
decibels
even
that
misses
the
problem
of
how
to
measure
delicate
whispers
that
are
hardly
audible

elvis
had
had
an
enlarged
heart
for
a
long
time
that
together
with
his
drug
habit
caused
his
death

he
was
difficult
to
diagnose
it
was
a
judgment
call[306]

allegations

a

were
widespread[306]
while
presley's
main
physician
dr
nichopoulos
was
exonerated
of
criminal
liability
for
the
singer's
death
the
facts
were
startling
in
the
first
eight
months
of
1977
alone
he
had
[prescribed]
more
than
10000
doses
of
sedatives
amphetamines
and
narcotics
all
in

name
his
license
was
suspended
for
three
months
it
was
permanently
revoked
in
the
1990s
after
the
tennessee
medical
board
brought
new
charges
of
overprescription[221]
amidst
mounting
pressure
in
1994
the
presley
autopsy
was
reopened
coroner
dr
joseph

declared
there
is
nothing
in
any
of

from

expressed

phenomenon
cracked
memphis's
segregation
laws
by
attending
the
local
amusement
park
on
what
was
designated
as
its
colored
night[36]
such
statements
and
actions
led
presley
to
be
generally
hailed
in
the
black
community
during
the
early
days
of
his
stardom[36]
by
contrast
many
white
adults
according
to
billboard's
arnold
shaw
did
not
like
him
and
condemned
him
as
depraved
antinegro
prejudice

antagonism
regardless
of
whether
parents
were
aware
of
the
negro
sexual
origins
of
the
phrase
'rock

presley
impressed
them
as
the
visual
and
aural
embodiment
of
sex[308]
despite
the
largely
positive
view
of
presley
held
by
african
americans

rumor
spread
in

announced

he
denied

found
no

that

who
had
heard
the
rumor
before
he
visited
graceland
one
evening
reported
of
presley
he
showed
me
every
courtesy
and
i
think
he's
one
of
the
greatest[310]
though
the
rumored
remark
was
wholly
discredited
at
the
time
it
was
still
being
used
against
presley
decades
later[311]
the
identification
of
presley
with
racism—either
personally
or
symbolically—was
expressed
most
famously
in
the
lyrics
of
the
1989
rap
hit

he
never

to
me
/
straightup
racist
that
sucker
was
/
simple
and
plain[312]
the
persistence
of
such
attitudes
was
fueled
by
resentment
over
the
fact
that
presley
whose
musical
and
visual
performance
idiom
owed
much
to
african
american
sources
achieved
the
cultural
acknowledgment
and
commercial
success
largely
denied
his
black
peers[309]
into
the
21st
century
the
notion
that
presley
had
stolen
black
music
still
found
adherents[311][312]
notable
among
african
american
entertainers
expressly
rejecting
this
view
was
jackie
wilson
who
argued
a
lot
of
people
have
accused
elvis
of
stealing
the
black
man's
music
when
in
fact
almost
every
black
solo
entertainer
copied
his
stage
mannerisms
from
elvis[313]
and
throughout
his
career
presley
plainly
acknowledged
his
debt
addressing
his
'68
comeback
special
audience
he
said
rock

roll
music
is
basically
gospel
or
rhythm
and
blues
or
it
sprang
from
that
people
have
been
adding
to
it
adding
instruments
to
it
experimenting
with
it
but
it
all
boils
down
to
[that]
nine
years
earlier
he

he
became

colonel

over
his
client's
career
early
on
he
and
his
hill

the
brothers
jean
and
julian
aberbach
perceived
the
close
relationship
that
developed
between
presley
and
songwriters
jerry
leiber
and
mike
stoller
as
a
serious
threat
to
that
control[315]
parker
effectively
ended
the
relationship
deliberately
or
not
with
the
new
contract
he
sent
leiber
in
early
1958
leiber
thought
there
was
a
mistake—the
sheet
of
paper
was
blank
except
for
parker's
signature
and
a
line
on
which
to
enter

there's

directed
don't
worry
we'll
fill
it
in
later
leiber
declined
and
presley's
fruitful
collaboration
with
the
writing
team
was
over[316]
other
respected
songwriters
lost
interest
in
or
simply
avoided
writing
for
presley
because
of
the
requirement
that
they
surrender
a
third
of
their
usual
royalties[317]
by
1967
parker's
contracts
with
presley
gave
him
50
percent
of
most
of
the
singer's
earnings
from
recordings
films
and
merchandise[318]
beginning
in
february
1972
he
took
a
third
of
the
profit
from
live
appearances[319]
a
january
1976
agreement
entitled
him
to
half
of
that
as
well[320]
priscilla
presley
noted
that
elvis
detested
the
business
side
of
his
career
he
would
sign
a
contract
without
even
reading
it[321]
presley's
friend
marty
lacker
regarded
parker
as
a
hustler
and
a
con
artist
he
was
only
interested
in
'now
money'—get
the
buck
and
get
gone[322]
lacker
was
instrumental
in
convincing
presley
to
record
with
memphis
producer
chips
moman
and
his
handpicked
musicians
at
american
sound
studio
in
early
1969
the
american
sound
sessions
represented
a
significant
departure
from
the
control
customarily
exerted
by
hill
and
range
moman
still
had
to
deal
with
the
publisher's
staff
on
site
whose
song
suggestions
he
regarded
as
unacceptable
he
was
on
the
verge
of
quitting
until
presley
ordered
the
hill
and
range
personnel
out
of
the
studio[323]
although
rca
executive
joan
deary
was
later
full
of
praise
for
the
producer's
song
choices
and
the
quality
of
the
recordings[324]
moman
to
his
fury
received
neither
credit
on
the
records
nor
royalties
for
his
work[325]
throughout
his
entire
career
presley
performed
in
only
three
venues
outside
the
united
states—all
of
them
in
canada
during
brief
tours
there
in
1957
rumors
that
he
would
play
overseas
for
the
first
time
were
fueled
in
1974
by
a
milliondollar
bid
for
an
australian
tour
parker
was
uncharacteristically
reluctant
prompting
those
close
to
presley
to
speculate
about
the
manager's
past
and
the
reasons
for
his
apparent
unwillingness
to
apply
for
a
passport
parker
ultimately
squelched
any
notions
presley
had
of
working
abroad
claiming
that
foreign
security
was
poor
and
the
venues
unsuitable
for
a
star
of
his
magnitude[326]
parker
arguably
exercised
tightest
control
over
presley's
movie
career
in
1957
robert
mitchum
asked
presley
to
costar
with
him
in
thunder
road
on
which
mitchum
was
writer
and
producer[327]
according
to
george
klein
one
of
his
oldest
friends
presley
was
offered
starring
roles
in
west
side
story
and
midnight
cowboy[328]

presley
to

with
her
in

of
a
star
is
born[329]
in
each
case
any
ambitions
the
singer
may
have
had
to
play
such
parts
were
thwarted
by
his
manager's
negotiating
demands
or
flat
refusals
in
lacker's
description
the
only
thing
that
kept
elvis
going
after
the
early
years
was
a
new
challenge
but
parker
kept
running
everything
into
the
ground[322]
the
operative
attitude
may
have
been
summed
up
best
by
the
response
leiber
and
stoller
received
when
they
brought
a
serious
film
project
for
presley
to
parker
and
the
hill
and
range
owners
for
their
consideration
in
leiber's
telling

warned
them

never
again
try

note
a
although
some
pronounce
his
surname
prezlee
presley
himself
used
the
pronunciation
of
the
american
south
presslee
as
did
his
family
and
those
who
worked
with
him[361]
the
correct
spelling
of
his
middle
name
has
long
been
a
matter
of
debate
the
physician
who
delivered
him
wrote
elvis
aaron
presley
in
his
ledger[362]
the
stateissued
birth
certificate
reads
elvis
aron
presley
the
name
was
chosen
after
the
presleys'
friend
and
fellow
congregation
member
aaron
kennedy
though
a
singlea
spelling
was
probably
intended
by
presley's
parents
in
order
to
parallel
the
middle
name
of
presley's
stillborn
brother
jesse
garon[138]
it
reads
aron
on
most
official
documents
produced
during
his
lifetime
including
his
high
school
diploma
rca
record
contract
and
marriage
license
and
this
was
generally
taken
to
be
the
proper
spelling[363]
in
1966
presley
expressed
the
desire
to
his
father
that
the
more
traditional
biblical
rendering
aaron
be
used
henceforth
especially
on
legal
documents[362]
five
years
later
the
jaycees
citation
honoring
him
as
one
of
the
country's
outstanding
young
men
used
aaron
late
in
his
life
he
sought
to
officially
change
the
spelling
to
aaron
and
discovered
that
state
records
already
listed
it
that
way
knowing
his
wishes
for
his
middle
name
aaron
is
the
spelling
his
father
chose
for
presley's
tombstone
and
it
is
the
spelling
his
estate
has
designated
as
official[363]
^
note
b
according
to
a
third
cousin
of
presley's
one
of
gladys's
greatgrandmothers
was
jewish[364]
there
is
no
evidence
that
presley
or
his
mother
shared
this
belief
in
a
jewish
heritage
syndicated
columnist
nate
bloom
has
challenged
the
cousin's
account
which
he
calls
a
tall
tale[365]

credited
as
