christian
bale
as
bruce
wayne
/
batman[11]
a
billionaire
socialite
dedicated
to
protecting
gotham
city
from
the
criminal
underworld
nolan
has
stated
that
due
to
the
eightyear
gap
between
the
events
of
the
dark
knight
and
those
of
the
dark
knight
rises
he's
an
older
bruce
wayne
he's
not
in
a
great
state[12]
bale
employed
a
mixed
martial
arts
discipline
called
the
keysi
fighting
method
but
due
to
bruce's
current
state
and
bane's
style
the
method
had
to
be
modified[13]
bale
has
stated
that
the
dark
knight
rises
will
be
the
final
film
in
which
he
plays
batman[14]
bale
describes
the
character's
arc
as
finally
confronting
the
pain
of
loss
that
he
has
deferred
for
years
by
fighting
criminals
balanced
against
the
need
to
internalise
that
pain
lest
he
give
into
his
emotions
and
become
the
killer
the
city
already
believes
him
to
be
bale
also
acknowledged
that
batman
is
not
a
flawless
individual
stating
that
he's
not
a
healthy
individual
this
is
somebody
that
is
doing
good
but
he's
right
on
the
verge
of
doing
bad
he's
got
that
killer
within
him
that
he's
desperately
not
trying
to
let
off
his
leash
and
that's
what
i
always
return
to[15]
bale
clarifies
that
he
doesn't
want
to
forget
[his
parents
[sic]
deaths]
he
wants
to
maintain
that
anger
he
felt
at
that
injustice
but
equally
he
wants
to
present
this
very
vacuous
soulless
persona
to
gotham
so
that
hopefully
noone
will
suspect
him
but
will
just
think
he's
a
spoiled
bastard[16]
bale
felt
bittersweet
about
leaving
the
franchise
clarifying
that
it
was
like
saying
goodbye
to
an
old
friend[17]
tom
hardy
as
bane[18]
a
terrorist
leader
intent
on
destroying
gotham
city
he
was
originally
a
member
of
the
league
of
shadows
before
being
excommunicated
the
character
was
chosen
by
christopher
nolan
even
though
he
was
unfamiliar
with
bane's
backstory
because
of
his
desire
to
see
batman
tested
on
both
a
physical
and
mental
level[19][12]
according
to
costume
designer
lindy
hemming
the
character
wears
a
mask
that
supplies
him
with
an
analgesic
gas
to
relieve
pain
he
suffers
from
an
injury
sustained
early
in
his
story[12]
bane
has
been
described
as
a
terrorist
in
both
thought
and
action[12]
and
is
florid
in
his
speech
[with]
the
physicality
of
a
gorilla[13]
hardy
stated
that
he
intended
to
portray
the
character
as
more
menacing
than
robert
swenson's
version
of
the
character
in
joel
schumacher's
batman

robin
and
that
in
order
to
do
so
his
portrayal
entailed
creating
a
contradiction
between
the
voice
and
the
body
hardy
gained
30
pounds
(14&nbspkg)
for
the
role[20]
increasing
his
weight
to
198
pounds
(90&nbspkg)[20]
hardy
based
the
character's
voice
on
several
influences
which
include
his
intellect
caribbean
heritage
and
bartley
gorman[21][22]
hardy
describes
bane's
fighting
style
as
[]
brutal
brutal
he's
a
big
dude
who's
incredibly
clinical
in
the
fact
that
he
has
a
resultbased
and
oriented
fighting
style
it's
not
about
fighting
it's
about
carnage
the
style
is
heavyhanded
heavyfooted
it's
nasty
anything
from
smalljoint
manipulation
to
crushing
skulls
crushing
rib
cages
stamping
on
shins
and
knees
and
necks
and
collarbones
and
snapping
heads
off
and
tearing
his
fists
through
chests
ripping
out
spinal
columns
he
is
a
terrorist
in
mentality
as
well
as
brutal
action[12]
anne
hathaway
as
selina
kyle[18][23]
selina
kyle
is
a
cat
burglar
described
as
an
associate
of
bane[24]
who
establishes
a
relationship
with
batman
that
takes
some
of
the
somberness
away
from
his
character[13]
kyle
is
pursuing
a
clean
slate
a
computer
program
rumoured
to
be
able
to
erase
a
person's
criminal
history
when
she
crosses
paths
with
bruce
wayne
hathaway
auditioned
not
knowing
what
role
she
was
being
considered
for
admitting
that
she
had
one
character
in
mind
but
only
learned
that
the
role
was
selina
kyle
after
talking
with
christopher
nolan
for
an
hour[25]
hathaway
described
the
role
as
being
the
most
physically
demanding
she
had
ever
played
and
confessed
that
while
she
thought
of
herself
as
being
fit
she
had
to
redouble
her
efforts
in
the
gym
to
keep
up
with
the
demands
of
the
role
hathaway
worked
out
five
days
a
week
for
the
role
including
rigorous
exercise
and
stunt
training
followed
by
an
hour
and
a
half
of
dance
she
explained
i've
always
thought
that
skinny
was
the
goal
but
with
this
job
i
also
have
to
be
strong[26][27][28]
hathaway
trained
extensively
in
martial
arts
for
the
role
and
looked
to
hedy
lamarr—who
was
the
inspiration
for
the
catwoman
character—in
developing
her
performance[24]
michael
caine
as
alfred
pennyworth[29]
bruce's
trusted
butler
and
confidant
alfred
has
acted
as
a
father
figure
to
bruce
and
continues
to
aid
bruce
on
his
missions
as
well
as
supplying
him
with
useful
advice
alfred
is
unable
to
accept
bruce's
desire
to
revive
his
batman
persona
even
going
so
far
as
to
resign
from
his
position
to
impress
the
seriousness
of
bruce's
position
upon
him
christopher
nolan
emphasised
the
emotional
bond
between
alfred
and
bruce
stressing
its
importance
in
the
previous
films
and
predicting
that
the
relationship
will
be
strained
as
it
never
has
before[13]

commissioner
of
the

department

one
of
the

few
honest

gary

described
the
character's
work
in
cleaning
up
gotham
city
as
having
left
him
worldweary
and
slightly
bored[30]
likening
gordon
to
a
soldier
who
leaps
at
the
chance
to
be
on
the
front
lines[13]
gordon
feels
guilty
over
his
role
in
covering
up
the
death
of
harvey
dent
to
the
point
where
he
is
prepared
to
resign
from
his
position
as
commissioner
over
it
but
refrains
from
doing
so
when
he
senses
that

is
about

horizon
seeing
something
of

in
blake
commissioner
gordon
promotes
him
to

blake
represents
the
idealism
that
gordon
and
bruce
wayne
once
held
but
soon
lost
in
their
battle
against
crime
in
the
city[13]

that

stating
that

production
development
the
key
thing
that
makes
the
third
film
a
great
possibility
for
us
is
that
we
want
to
finish
our
story
[]
rather
than
infinitely
blowing
up
the
balloon
and
expanding
the
story
[]
unlike
the
comics
these
things
don't
go
on
forever
in
film
and
viewing
it
as
a
story
with
an
end
is
useful
viewing
it
as
an
ending
that
sets
you
very
much
on
the
right
track
about
the
appropriate
conclusion
—christopher
nolan
confirming
his
involvement
in
the
dark
knight
rises[59]
warner
bros
president
of
production
jeff
robinov
had
hoped
a
third
film
would
be
released
in
2011
or
2012[60]
nolan
wanted
the
story
for
the
third
installment
to
keep
him
emotionally
invested
on
a
more
superficial
level
i
have
to
ask
the
question
he
reasoned
how
many
good
third
movies
in
a
franchise
can
people
name?[61]
nolan
said
that
he
never
even
thought
a
third
film
was
possible
in
the
foreword
for
his
book
the
art
and
making
of
the
dark
knight
trilogy[62]
nolan
only
agreed
to
a
third
film
on
the
basis
of
finding
a
worthwhile
story
fearing
that
he
would
become
bored
halfway
through
production
if
he
discovered
the
film
to
be
unnecessary[4]
by
december
2008
nolan
completed
a
rough
story
outline
before
he
committed
himself
to
inception[63]
later
in
december
alan
f
horn
confirmed
that
while
discussions
with
nolan
about
a
third
film
were
ongoing
no
casting
had
been
done
and
horn
denied
all
such
rumors[64]
before
nolan
confirmed
his
involvement
gary
oldman
had
said
he
was
confident
nolan
would
return[65]
following
the
success
of
the
joker
in
the
dark
knight
studio
executives
wished
for
the
riddler
to
be
included
as
the
primary
villain
as
he
was
considered
a
similar
character
and
encouraged
the
casting
of
leonardo
dicaprio[66]
however
nolan
wanted
the
antagonist
to
be
vastly
different
than
the
previous
incarnations
and
committed
to
using
bane
instead[66]
citing
the
need
for
a
character
with
a
physical
presence
within
the
film[67]
he
was
initially
unfamiliar
with
the
character's
backstory[19]
but
pointed
out
the
appeal
of
an
archetype
labelling
it
as
the
extreme
of
some
type
of
villainy
when
comparing
the
choice
of
bane
with
the
joker
nolan
highlighted
the
joker
as
an
example
of
diabolical
chaotic
anarchy
and
has
a
devilish
sense
of
humor
juxtaposing
him
against
bane
who
he
likened
to
a
classic
movie
monster
[]
with
a
terrific
brain[67]
it
was
not
until
february
9
2010
that
it
was
announced
that
nolan
had
cracked
the
story
of
a
sequel
to
the
dark
knight
and
was
committed
to
return
to
the
project[68]
shortly
afterward
it
was
announced
david
s
goyer
and
jonathan
nolan
were
working
on
a
screenplay[69]
goyer
would
leave
the
project
during
preproduction
to
begin
work
on
man
of
steel
jonathan
continued
writing
the
script
based
on
the
story
by
his
brother
chris
and
goyer[29]
chris
nolan
said
that
his
brother's
original
draft
was
about
400
pages[70]
the
film's
storyline
has
been
compared
with
the
batman
comic
book
series'
story
arcs
knightfall
(1993)
which
showcased
bane
the
dark
knight
returns
(1986)
in
which
batman
returns
to
gotham
city
after
a
tenyear
absence
no
man's
land
(1999)
which
depicts
a
gotham
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
overrun
by
gangs
and
batman
legacy
(1996)
which
had
a
similar
plot
to
the
film[5][6][71]
the
nickname
the
dark
knight
was
first
applied
to
batman
in
batman
no
1
(1940)
in
a
story
written
by
bill
finger[72][73]
nolan
confirmed
the
joker
would
not
return
in
the
third
film
and
dismissed
rumors
that
he
considered
using
unused
footage
of
heath
ledger
from
the
dark
knight[74]
the
dark
knight
rises
reunited
nolan
with
many
of
his
past
collaborators
including

wally

filming
the
tumbler
on
the
set
of
the
dark
knight
rises
in
pittsburgh
during
location
scouting
in
december
2010
nolan
began
searching
for
locations
such
as
india
romania
and
michigan[76][77][78]
according
to
the
romania
insider
nolan
was
interested
in
the
bucharest's
historical
center
edgar
quinet
street
palace
of
the
parliament
and
the
turda
salt
mines[76]
the
film
had
an
estimated
budget
of
$250–300
million
coming
down
to
about
$230
million
after
tax
credits[2]
nolan
elected
not
to
film
in
3d
but
instead
stated
that
he
intended
to
focus
on
improving
image
quality
and
scale
using
the
imax
format[79]
the
dark
knight
rises
featured
over
an
hour
of
footage
shot
in
imax
(by
comparison
the
dark
knight
contained
28
minutes)[80][81]
nolan
had
several
meetings
with
imax
vicepresident
david
keighley
to
work
on
the
logistics
of
projecting
films
in
digital
imax
venues[81]
wally
pfister
had
expressed
interest
in
shooting
the
film
entirely
in
imax[82]
but
because
of
the
considerable
noise
made
by
imax
cameras
35mm
and
70mm
cameras
had
to
be
used
for
shooting
the
film's
dialogue
scenes[81][83]
as
dialogue
had
to
be
dubbed
when
shot
with
imax
cameras[84]
chairman
and
president
of
the
imax
corporation
greg
foster
stated
that
imax
plans
to
run
the
film
in
its
theatres
for
two
months
despite
only
being
contractually
committed
to
run
the
film
for
two
weeks[85]
nolan
also
bypassed
the
use
of
a
digital
intermediate
for
the
film
resulting
in
less
manipulation
of
the
filmed
image
and
higher
film
resolution[86]

christopher
nolan
invited
many
of
america's
most
prominent
directors
including
edgar
wright
michael
bay
bryan
singer
jon
favreau
eli
roth
duncan
jones
and
stephen
daldry
to
universal
citywalk's
imax
theatre
for
a
private
screening
of
the
first
six
minutes
of
the
dark
knight
rises
which
had
been
shot
on
imax
film
and
edited
from
the
original
camera
negative
nolan
feeling
that
the
use
of
film
stock
in
cinema
is
currently
being
phased
out
due
to
the
introduction
of
digital
cinematography
and
projection
used
this
screening
to
make
a
case
for
the
continued
use
of
film
which
he
asserts
still
offers
superior
image
quality
to
any
digital
format
and
warned
the
filmmakers
that
unless
they
continued
to
assert
their
choice
to
use
film
in
their
productions
they
may
eventually
lose
it
as
an
option[109][110]
nolan
explained
i
wanted
to
give
them
a
chance
to
see
the
potential
because
i
think
imax
is
the
best
film
format
that
was
ever
invented
it’s
the
gold
standard
and
what
any
other
technology
has
to
match
up
to
but
none
have
in
my
opinion
the
message
i
wanted
to
put
out
there
was
that
no
one
is
taking
anyone’s
digital
cameras
away
but
if
we
want
film
to
continue
as
an
option
and
someone
is
working
on
a
big
studio
movie
with
the
resources
and
the
power
to
insist
[on]
film
they
should
say
so
i
felt
as
if
i
didn’t
say
anything
and
then
we
started
to
lose
that
option
it
would
be
a
shame
when
i
look
at
a
digitally
acquired
and
projected
image
it
looks
inferior
against
an
original
negative
anamorphic
print
or
an
imax
one[109]

of
tom
hardy's

was
used
to

and
construct
bane's
mask
costume
designer
lindy
hemming
explained
that
bane
uses
a
mask
to
inhale
an
analgesic
gas
which
in
director
christopher
nolan's
words
keeps
his
pain
just
below
the
threshold
so
he
can
function
in
designing
bane’s
costume
hemming
needed
it
to
look
“like
an
amalgam
of
all
sorts
of
bits
and
pieces
he
cobbled
together
as
he
passed
through
some
very
remote
places
we
made
parts
of
his
vest
for
example
from
fragments
of
an
old
military
tent
his
clothes
are
militaristic
but
are
not
in
any
way
a
uniform”
hemming
also
designed
bane's
mask
to
look
animalistic[111][112][13]

supervisor
graham
churchyard
created
a
threedimensional
model
of
actor
tom
hardy's
face
and

to
design
the
mask
allowing
the
mask
to
perfectly
conform
to
the
contours
of
hardy's
face[13]
hemming
personally
designed
bane's
coat
which
she
admitted
took
two
years
to
complete
taking
inspiration
from
a
swedish
army
jacket
and
a
frock
coat
from
the
french
revolution
it
was
designed
to
make
bane
look
like
equal
parts
dictatorial
and
revolutionary[13]
the
design
was
difficult
as
hemming
struggled
to
find
a
tailor
in
los
angeles
who
could
work
with
shearling[113]
the
batsuit
consisted
of
110
separate
pieces
each
of
which
had
to
be
replicated
dozens
of
times
over
the
course
of
the
production
the
base
layer
was
made
of
a
polyester
mesh
that
is
utilized
by
the
military
and
hightech
sports
manufacturers
because
of
its
breathability
and
moisturewicking
properties
molded
pieces
of
flexible
urethane
were
then
attached
to
the
mesh
to
form
the
overall
body
armor
plating
carbon
fiber
panels
were
placed
inside
the
sections
on

the
cowl
was
sculpted
from
a
cast
of
bale's
face
and
head
to
become
a
perfect
fit
for

bale
the
suit
remained
unchanged
for
the
film
since
the
dark
knight[13]
in
creating
selina
kyle's
catsuit
two
layers
of
material
were
used
with
the
outer
layer
being
polyurethane
coated
spandex
embossed
with

the

was
christopher
nolan's
visual
style
one
of
the
things
that
makes
his
batman
movies
so
compelling
is
their
tone
of
plausibility
he
will
often
prefer
a
raw
grittier
design
over
one
that
is
very
sleek
and
product
design
pretty
it's
sort
of
a
practical
military
aesthetic
this
stuff
is
made
to
work
not
impress
shoppers
the
dark
knight
rises
is
a
war
film[114]
producer
emma
thomas
stated
this
batman
film
has
a
different
visual
aesthetic
from
the
first
two
nolandirected
features
explaining
that
it's
meant
to
be
winter
in
gotham
so
that
right
there
is
going
to
lend
a
whole
different
look
to
the
film[115]
the
film
introduces
a
vehicle
that
has
been
compared
with
the
batplane
dubbed
the
bat
in
designing
the
bat
nathan
crowley
approached
it
as
if
it
were
an
actual
military
project
emphasising
the
need
for
it
to
fit
into
the
same
family
as
the
tumbler
and
the
batpod
the
final
version
of
the
bat
takes
its
design
cues
from
the
harrier
jump
jet
bell
boeing
v22
osprey
and
the
boeing
ah64
apache[13]
chris
corbould
described
the
bat's
size
and
shape
as
presenting
a
major
challenge
for
filming
given
christopher
nolan's
emphasis
on
practical
effects
over
computergenerated
imagery
in
order
to
make
the
bat
fly
it
was
variously
supported
by
wires
suspended
from
cranes
and
helicopters
and
mounted
on
a
purposebuilt
vehicle
with
hydraulic
controls
to
simulate
movement[13][116][117]
when
designing
the
batcave
set
crowley
and
fellow
production
designer
kevin
kavanaugh
hit
upon
the
idea
of
flooding
the
batcave
and
having
batman's
equipment
the
batsuit
and
a
supercomputer
rise
from
the
water[13]
another
set
was
designed
at
cardington
as
an
underground
prison
a
roughhewn
labyrinth
of
stone
cells
in
a
vast
abyss
with
a
120
foot
(37&nbspm)
vertical
shaft
leading
to
the
surface
exteriors
above
the
prison
were
filmed
in
jodhpur
india
chosen
because
the
forbidding
landscape
added
to
the
desolation[13]

main
article
the
dark
knight
rises
(soundtrack)
in
an
interview
in
october
2010
composer
hans
zimmer
confirmed
that
he
would
be
returning
to
score
the
dark
knight
rises
james
newton
howard
was
offered
to
return
and
write
the
score
with
zimmer
as
he
did
for
batman
begins
and
the
dark
knight
but
he
chose
not
to
because
he
noted
that
the
chemistry
established
between
zimmer
and
nolan
during
the
making
of
inception
would
make
him
seem
like
a
third
wheel[118]
zimmer
included
several
cues
from
the
earlier
scores
but
explains
that
he
wanted
to
go
in
a
completely
different
direction
for
bane's
theme
while
the
theme
accompanying
selina
kyle
is
deliberately
ambiguous
the
musical
thread
spanning
throughout
the
trilogy
was
composed
exclusively
for
bruce
wayne[13]
the
film
features
a
prevalent
moroccan
chant
of
the
phrase
deshi
basara
(arabic
تيجي
بسرعة)
which
translates
to
rise
up
(both
words
are
repeated
in
a
sentence)[119][120]
in
november
2011
zimmer
crowdsourced
online
audio
recordings
of
the
chant
to
be
used
in
the
film's
score[121][122]
when
asked
about
the
chant
for
clarification
zimmer
said
the
chant
became
a
very
complicated
thing
because
i
wanted
hundreds
of
thousands
of
voices
and
it's
not
so
easy
to
get
hundreds
of
thousands
of
voices
so
we
twittered
and
we
posted
on
the
internet
for
people
who
wanted
to
be
part
of
it
it
seemed
like
an
interesting
thing
we've
created
this
world
over
these
last
two
movies
and
somehow
i
think
the
audience
and
the
fans
have
been
part
of
this
world
we
do
keep
them
in
mind[123]

than

outlaw
criticized
the
quality
writing
that
a
scene
depicting
commissioner

hospital
bed
was
overly
dramatic
had
hammy
dialogue
and
was

the

i
would
not

anything
about
the

that
they
were

are
one
of

the

the

that
someone

an

is
devastating
to
me
nothing
any

identified
as

james
eagan
holmes[221]
shortly
after
arriving
on
the
scene[222]
at
the
time
of
his

holmes
allegedly
identified
himself
as
the

to

that
it

by
the
shooting
and
announced
the
cancellation
of
the
paris
mexico
and
japan
premieres
of
the

and
suspended
the
marketing
campaign
for
the

in
finland[227]
several
broadcast
networks
also
suspended

ads
for

and
the

to
1980s
popular
culture
reflecting
the

period
of
the
time

of
perpetuating
a
conservative

just
as
so
many
1980s

we

products
notsosubtly
reflect
the
tea
party’s
rhetorical
backlash
to
the
powerful
occupy
wall
street
zeitgeist[232]
an
article
in
variety
reported
chuck
dixon
the
cocreator
of
the
bane
character
as
saying
that
bane
is
far
more
akin
to
an
occupy
wall
street
type
if
you're
looking
to
cast
him
politically[233]
catherine
shoard
of

british
publication
the
guardian
claimed
the
film
is
a
quite
audaciously
capitalist
vision
radically
conservative
radically
vigilante
that
advances
a
serious
stirring
proposal
that
the
wishfulfilment
of
the
wealthy
is
to
be
championed
if
they
say
they
want
to
do
good[235]
in
contrast
liberal
commentator
jonathan
chait
opined
in
new
york
that
what
passes
for
a
rightwing
movie
these
days
is
the
dark
knight
rises
which
submits
the
rather
modest
premise
that
irritating
though
the
rich
may
be
actually
killing
them
and
taking
all
their
stuff
might
be
excessive[236]
writing
in
usa
today
bryan
alexander
called
bane
the
ultimate
occupier
and
reported
that
christian
bale
was
amazed
that
the
script
had
foreseen
the
occupy
movement[237]
nolan
has
denied
the
film
criticizes
the
occupy
movement
and
insists
that
none
of
his
batman
films
are
intended
to
be
political
i've
had
as
many
conversations
with
people
who
have
seen
the
film
the
other
way
round
we
throw
a
lot
of
things
against
the
wall
to
see
if
it
sticks
we
put
a
lot
of
interesting
questions
in
the
air
but
that's
simply
a
backdrop
for
the
story
what
we're
really
trying
to
do
is
show
the
cracks
of
society
show
the
conflicts
that
somebody
would
try
to
wedge
open
we're
going
to
get
wildly
different
interpretations
of
what
the
film
is
supporting
and
not
supporting
but
it's
not
doing
any
of
those
things
it's
just
telling
a
story
if
you're
saying
'have
you
made
a
film
that's
supposed
to
be
criticizing
the
occupy
wall
street
movement?'
–
well
obviously
that's
not
true[238]
alternatively
politically
conservative
commentator
rush
limbaugh
alleged
that
the
film
was
biased
against
2012
republican
presidential
nominee
mitt
romney
due
to
bane's
name
being
a
homophone
for
bain
capital
the
financial
service
company
romney
used
to
head[239][240][241]
in
response
nolan
said
that
the
comments
were
bizarre[242]
while
dixon
and
freeman
said
that
the
comments
were
ridiculous[241][243]
similarly
comparisons
between
bane
and
bain
have
also
been
made
by
bloggers
on
both
sides
of
the
political
spectrum[241]
with
democratic
adviser
christopher
lehane
noting
the
similarities
between
the
narratives
of
the
film
and
the
presidential
campaign[244][241]

the
