the
eagle
has
landed
(1970)
unfortunately
i
was
out
of
town
when
neil
armstrong
died
on
august
25
2012
so
i
didn't
get
to
post
about
it&nbsphis
deeds
and
those
of
the
apollo
11
crew
were
a
huge
influence
on
my
life
and
dreams&nbsp
so
this
posting
is
dedicated
to
neil&nbsp
he
would
have
liked
this
one
just
the
facts
no
hype
the
wonderful
paintings
are
almost
impressionistic
in
their
simplicity
