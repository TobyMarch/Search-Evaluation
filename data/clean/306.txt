lewis
described
the
origin
of
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
in
an
essay
entitled
it
all
began
with
a
picture
[5]
the
lion
all
began
with
a
picture
of
a
faun
carrying
an
umbrella
and
parcels
in
a
snowy
wood
this
picture
had
been
in
my
mind
since
i
was
about
sixteen
then
one
day
when
i
was
about
forty
i
said
to
myself
'let's
try
to
make
a
story
about
it'
shortly
before
world
war
ii
many
children
were
evacuated
from
london
to
the
english
countryside
to
escape
attacks
on
london
by
nazi
germany
on
2
september
1939
three
school
girls
margaret
mary
and
katherine[6]
came
to
live
at
the
kilns
in
risinghurst
lewis's
home
three
miles
east
of
oxford
city
centre
lewis
later
suggested
that
the
experience
gave
him
a
new
appreciation
of
children
and
in
late
september[7]
he
began
a
children's
story
on
an
odd
sheet
which
has
survived
as
part
of
another
manuscript
this
book
is
about
four
children
whose
names
were
ann
martin
rose
and
peter
but
it
is
most
about
peter
who
was
the
youngest
they
all
had
to
go
away
from
london
suddenly
because
of
air
raids
and
because
father
who
was
in
the
army
had
gone
off
to
the
war
and
mother
was
doing
some
kind
of
war
work
they
were
sent
to
stay
with
a
kind
of
relation
of
mother's
who
was
a
very
old
professor
who
lived
all
by
himself
in
the
country
[8]
how
much
more
of
the
story
lewis
then
wrote
is
uncertain
roger
lancelyn
green
thinks
that
he
might
even
have
completed
it
in
september
1947
c
s
lewis
wrote
in
a
letter
about
stories
for
children
i
have
tried
one
myself
but
it
was
by
the
unanimous
verdict
of
my
friends
so
bad
that
i
destroyed
it[9]
in
august
1948
during
the
visit
of
the
american
writer
chad
walsh
lewis
vaguely
talked
about
completing
a
children's
book
which
he
had
begun
in
the
tradition
of
e
nesbit[10]
after
this
conversation
not
much
happened
–
until
the
beginning
of
the
next
year
then
everything
changed
in
his
essay
it
all
began
with
a
picture
c
s
lewis
continues
at
first
i
had
very
little
idea
how
the
story
would
go
but
then
suddenly
aslan
came
bounding
into
it
i
think
i
had
been
having
a
good
many
dreams
of
lions
about
that
time
apart
from
that
i
don't
know
where
the
lion
came
from
or
why
he
came
but
once
he
was
there
he
pulled
the
whole
story
together
and
soon
he
pulled
the
six
other
narnian
stories
in
after
him[11]
on
10
march
1949
roger
lancelyn
green
dined
with
him
at
magdalen
college
after
the
meal
lewis
read
two
chapters
from
his
new
children's
story
to
green
lewis
asked
green's
opinion
of
the
tale
and
green
thought
it
was
good
the
manuscript
of
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
was
complete
by
the
end
of
march
1949
lucy
barfield
received
it
by
the
end
of
may[12]
when
on
16
october
1950
geoffrey
bles
in
london
published
the
first
edition
three
new
chronicles
–
prince
caspian
the
voyage
of
the
dawn
treader
and
the
horse
and
his
boy
–
had
also
been
completed
illustrations
lewis’s
publisher
geoffrey
bles
allowed
him
to
choose
the
illustrator
for
the
novel
and
the
narnia
series
his
choice
was
pauline
baynes
possibly
as
a
result
of
j
r
r
tolkien’s
recommendation
baynes
had
greatly
impressed
tolkien
with
her
illustrations
for
his
farmer
giles
of
ham
(1949)
however
baynes
claimed
that
lewis
learned
about
her
work
after
going
into
a
bookshop
and
asking
for
a
recommendation
of
an
illustrator
who
was
skilled
at
portraying
both
humans
and
animals

1949
geoffrey
bles
showed
lewis
the
first
drawings
for
the
novel
and
lewis
sent
baynes
a
note
congratulating
her
particularly
on
the
level
of
detail
lewis’s
appreciation
of
the
illustrations
is
evident
in
a
letter
lewis
wrote
to
baynes
after
the
last
battle
won
the
carnegie
medal
for
best
children’s
book
of
1956
“is
it
not
rather
‘our’
medal?
i’m
sure
the
illustrations
were
taken
into
account
as
well
as
the
text[13]
the
british
edition
of
the
novel
had
43
illustrations
american
editions
generally
had
fewer
the
popular
united
states
paperback
edition
published
by
collier
between
1970
and
1994
which
sold
many
millions
had
only
17
illustrations
many
of
them
severely
cropped
from
the
originals
giving
many
readers
in
that
country
a
very
different
experience
when
reading
the
novel
all
the
illustrations
were
restored
for
the
1994
worldwide
harpercollins
edition
although
these
lacked
the
clarity
of
early
printings[14]
reception
lewis
very
much
enjoyed
writing
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
and
embarked
on
the
sequel
prince
caspian
soon
after
finishing
the
first
novel
he
completed
the
sequel
in
less
than
a
year
by
the
end
of
1949
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
had
not
been
widely
released
until
1950
thus
his
initial
enthusiasm
did
not
stem
from
favourable
reception
by
the
public[15]
while
lewis
is
known
today
on
the
strength
of
the
narnia
stories
as
a
highly
successful
children’s
writer
the
initial
critical
response
was
muted
at
the
time
it
was
fashionable
for
children’s
stories
to
be
realistic
fantasy
and
fairy
tales
were
seen
as
indulgent
appropriate
only
for
very
young
readers
and
potentially
harmful
to
older
children
even
hindering
their
ability
to
relate
to
everyday
life
some
reviewers
thought
the
tale
overtly
moralistic
or
the
christian
elements
overstated
—
attempts
to
indoctrinate
children
others
were
concerned
that
the
many
violent
incidents
might
frighten
children[16]
lewis’s
publisher
geoffrey
bles
feared
that
the
narnia
tales
would
not
sell
and
might
damage
lewis’s
reputation
and
affect
sales
of
his
other
books
nevertheless
the
novel
and
its
successors
were
highly
popular
with
young
readers
and
lewis’s
publisher
was
soon
anxious
to
release
further
narnia
stories[17]
a
2004
study
found
that
it
was
a
common
readaloud
book
for
seventhgraders
in
schools
in
san
diego
county
california[18]
the
novel
was
#58
on
time's
2005
list
of
the
100
best
englishlanguage
novels
published
since
1923[1]
based
on
a
2007
online
poll
the
national
education
association
in
the
us
named
the
book
one
of
its
teachers'
top
100
books
for
children[19]
it
was
one
of
the
top
100
chapter
books
of
all
time
in
a
2012
poll
by
school
library
journal[20]
a
2012
survey
by
the
university
of
worcester
determined
that
it
was
the
second
most
common
book
that
uk
adults
had
read
as
children
after
alice's
adventures
in
wonderland[21]
allusions
the
main
story
is
an
allegory
of
christ's
crucifixion[22]
aslan
sacrifices
himself
for
edmund
a
traitor
who
may
deserve
death
in
the
same
way
that
christians
believe
jesus
sacrificed
himself
for
sinners
aslan
is
killed
on
the
stone
table
symbolizing
mosaic
law
which
breaks
when
he
is
resurrected
symbolizing
the
replacement
of
the
strict
justice
of
old
testament
law
with
christ's
forgiveness
according
to
christian
theology[23]
as
with
the
christian
passion
it
is
women
(susan
and
lucy)
who
tend
aslan's
body
after
he
dies
and
are
the
first
to
see
him
after
his
resurrection
the
significance
of
the
death
contains
elements
of
both
the
ransom
theory
of
atonement
and
the
satisfaction
theory
aslan
suffers
edmund's
penalty
(satisfaction)
and
buys
him
back
from
the
white
witch
who
was
entitled
to
him
by
reason
of
his
treachery
(ransom)
in
christian
tradition
christ
is
associated
with
the
biblical
lion
of
judah
mainly
on
the
strength
of
revelation
55
professor
kirke
is
based
on
wt
kirkpatrick
who
tutored
a
16yearold
lewis
kirk
as
he
was
sometimes
called
taught
the
young
lewis
much
about
thinking
and
communicating
clearly
skills
that
would
be
invaluable
to
him
later[24]
narnia
is
caught
in
endless
winter
that
has
lasted
a
century
when
the
children
first
enter
norse
tradition
mythologises
a
great
winter
known
as
the
fimbulwinter
said
to
precede
ragnar&oumlk
the
trapping
of
edmund
by
the
white
witch
is
reminiscent
of
the
seduction
and
imprisonment
of
kay
by
the
snow
queen
in
hans
christian
andersen's
novella
of
that
name[25]
the
dwarves
and
giants
are
found
in
norse
mythology
fauns
centaurs
minotaurs
and
dryads
derive
from
greek
mythology
father
christmas
of
course
was
part
of
popular
english
folklore
there
are
several
parallels
between
the
white
witch
and
the
immortal
protagonist
of
h
rider
haggard's
she
a
novel
greatly
admired
by
cs
lewis[26]
the
story
of
the
amulet
written
by
edith
nesbit
also
contains
scenes
that
can
be
considered
as
sources
to
sequences
presenting
jadis
mostly
in
the
magician's
nephew[27]
the
freeing
of
aslan's
body
from
the
stone
table
by
field
mice
is
reminiscent
of
aesop's
fable
of
the
lion
and
the
mouse
in
the
fable
a
lion
catches
a
mouse
but
the
mouse
persuades
the
lion
to
release
him
promising
that
the
favor
would
be
rewarded
later
in
the
story
he
gnaws
through
the
lion's
bonds
after
he
has
been
captured
by
hunters
it
is
also
reminiscent
of
a
scene
from
edgar
allan
poe's
story
the
pit
and
the
pendulum
in
which
a
prisoner
is
freed
when
rats
gnaw
through
his
bonds[28]
