this
book
is
a
must
have
for
anyone
who
has
seen
lolita
or
for
those
who
are
unable
to
see
it
at
the
moment
the
script
by
stephen
schiff
is
incredible!
he
leaves
nothing
out
or
tries
to
hid
anything
every
scene
every
word
clear
as
a
bell
i
myself
have
not
seen
lolita
yet
but
have
read
the
book
by
nabokov
i
believe
mr
schiff
stuck
strickly
to
nabokovs
book
the
photos
in
the
book
are
an
added
bonus
to
fans
of
the
film
or
the
actors
in
the
film
so
if
you
happen
to
be
a
lolita
nabokov
or
lyne
fan
this
is
the
book
for
you

verified
purchase
by
lolita
saga
i
mean
not
just
nabokov's
fairy
tale
(as
he
says
all
great
novels
are)
but
the
story
of
how
the
novel
and
the
films
of
lyne
and
kubrick
came
to
be
from
nabokov's
novel
onward
all
attempts
to
tell
the
story
of
the
doomed
humbert
and
the
doomed
lolita
(and
the
doomed
charlotte
and
the
deservedly
doomed
quilty)
have
faced
headwinds
from
cowardly
moneymen
and
ignorant
critics
and
censors
who
condemned
with
their
eyes
and
ears
as
primly
closed
as
their
minds
lyne's
film
fortunately
survived
those
gales
it
is
also
worthwhile
to
note
how
lyne's
film
diverges
from
this
screenplay
some
of
the
scenes
cut
from
the
movie
appear
as
bonus
material
on
the
dvd
others
just
disappeared
others
were
changed
for
filming
but
all
are
part
of
the
overall
story
of
the
film
and
the
(somewhat)
conflicting
visions
of
it's
contributors
i
have
a
couple
of
nits
to
pick
with
schiff
however
he
states
in
the
introduction
that
he
shut
himself
off
from
earlier
efforts
my
source
material
was
the
novel
itself
yet
there
are
places
where
schiff's
screenplay
follows
kubrick's
film
and/or
nabokov's
screenplay
but
conflicts
with
the
novel
for
instance
humbert's
reason
for
coming
to
the
us
in
the
novel
is
that
his
deceased
uncle's
will
promised
him
a
sizeable
monthly
stipend
if
he
would
come
to
the
us
and
pretend
to
take
an
interest
in
the
business
mark
twain
(and
jimmy
buffett)
would
say
humbert
was
a
remittance
man
a
black
sheep
paid
to
go
away
and
stop
embarrassing
the
family
in
nabokov's
screenplay
and
kubrick's
film
humbert
is
a
writer
and
distinguished
scholar
who
comes
to
the
us
to
lecture
at
beardsley
college
schiff's
screenplay
(and
lyne's
film)
follow
the
earlier
film
and
screenplay
not
the
novel
more
grievously
he
says
dominique
swain
wasn't
quite
beautiful
now
maybe
i'm
one
of
those
tortured
artists
who
know
a
nymphet
when
they
see
one
and
schiff
isn't
but
there
are
50odd
screenshots
within
lyne's
film
in
which
dominique
swain
appears
not
only
as
beautiful
but
as
heartstoppingly
so
schiff's
description
might
fit
ds
as
she
appeared
in
her
later
films
but
to
me
part
of
the
mystique
of
the
lyne
film
is
that
he
cast
dominique
swain
as
lolita
while
swain
was
in
her
alltoobrief
nymphet
stage
then
she
moved
on
like
a
nabokov
butterfly
fortunately
leaving
behind
for
us
her
magnificent
portrayal
of
lolita
recorded
for
the
ages
as
humbert
(or
is
it
nabokov?)
says
in
finality
and
this
is
the
only
immortality
you
and
i
may
share
my
lolita
and
so
it
is!

should
read
the
shooting
script
of
the
film
july
12
2009
by
steven
daedalus
formatpaperback|amazon
verified
purchase
there's
a
very
brief
entry
by
jeremy
irons
a
slightly
longer
one
by
lyne
that
deals
with
the
travails
of
the
film
following
its
release
after
everyone's
heroic
effort
to
get
it
made
then
peter
schiff's
longer
introduction
that
covers
much
of
the
same
ground
in
greater
detail
the
bulk
of
the
book
is
made
up
of
the
shooting
script

the
scenes
as
they
were
written
and
filmed

before
the
actual
editing
and
trimming
plus
a
lot
of
real
estate
devoted
to
screen
shots
from
the
film
i
said
schiff's
essay
gives
us
greater
detail
but
greater
is
such
a
relative
term
it's
clear
that
getting
the
production
funded
filmed
and
marketed
was
a
nightmare
but
i'd
have
liked
to
know
more
about
some
of
the
preproduction
decisions
regarding
the
movie
as
movie

not
as
so
much
of
the
public
(and
professionals)
saw
it
a
rabblerousing
endorsement
of
pedophilia
schiff
tells
us
that
irons
was
the
obvious
choice
for
humbert
fine
but
why?
and
what
made
dominique
swain
stand
out
from
the
thousands
of
other
young
girls
whose
mothers
would
willingly
have
them
debauched
on
screen?
well

we
don't
find
out
the
rest
of
the
book
is
in
many
ways
more
interesting
than
the
introductory
sections
it
follows
pretty
closely
the
dialog
and
events
we
see
in
the
finished
product
but
the
excisions
are
fascinating
in
themselves
what
a
country
of
blue
noses
we
are
the
scene
in
which
hh
has
his
first
orgasm
with
lolita
on
the
sunday
living
room
couch
is
gone
for
instance
too
much
forbidden
sex
although
lolita
may
be
unaware
of
what
happens
but
the
climactic
killing
of
quilty
with
all
its
agony
and
its
oceans
of
gore
is
intact
it's
okay
to
shoot
a
man
in
cold
blood
to
put
innumerable
holes
through
his
naked
body
and
to
show
it
realistically

but
don't
touch
a
fourteenyearold
knee
the
script
presented
here
follows
the
novel
far
more
closely
than
kubrick's
did
in
some
ways
it's
a
weakness
because
a
lot
of
what
goes
on
in
the
novel
isn't
spelled
out
in
the
dialog
only
in
hh's
descriptions
of
it
as
schiff
points
out
this
requires
that
some
original
dialog
be
added
and
the
writers
(who
included
at
one
point
david
mamet)
do
a
pretty
good
job
of
it
it's
tough
enough
to
squeeze
a
classic
novel
into
the
shape
of
a
movie
joseph
strick
tried
it
with
ulysses
and
it
was
a
dismal
failure
lyne's
lolita
more
closely
approaches
success
i
was
reminded
of
another
attempt
to
shape
a
long
and
complex
novel
into
a
film
the
caine
mutiny
in
the
book
captain
queeg's
paranoia
gradually
reveals
itself
in
a
series
of
related
incidents
of
enough
intricacy
that
they
simply
couldn't
be
depicted
in
the
movie
so
early
on
during
the
first
wardroom
meeting
queeg's
neurotic
behavior
is
adumbrated
in
a
single
statement
he's
describing
his
experiences
in
the
atlantic
and
adds
the
way
those
subs
ganged
up
on
us
i
thought
they
had
it
in
for
me
persnally
to
me
that
represents
skillfull
screen
writing
and
the
script
of
lolita
shows
it
in
abundance
yet
by
sticking
to
the
events
of
the
novel
as
closely
as
it
does
the
script
misses
something
it
misses
the
same
thing
that
strick's
version
of
ulysses
did
lolita
is
at
base
a
serious
and
even
tragic
story
but
not
as
hh
tells
it
a
few
earnest
passages
aside
it's
hilarious
but
the
script
can't
capture
most
of
the
comic
turns
taken
by
nabokov's
prose
what
little
humor
there
is
is
confined
to
a
few
brief
moments

the
mixups
over
hh's
name
for
instance
at
the
beardsley
school
for
girls
the
headmistress
addresses
him
as
professor
himmler
and
at
the
enchanted
hunters
he
coldly
informs
the
clerk
that
the
name
is
not
humbug
but
herbert

i
mean
humbert
and
man
does
this
script
need
some
of
the
novel's
humor
kubrick
at
least
had
a
noncanonical
peter
sellers
in
five
different
roles
(some
were
more
successful
than
others)
and
it
had
an
africanamerican
hotel
porter
wrestling
with
a
foldup
cot
that
insisted
on
reverting
to
its
more
compact
form
lyne's
movie
has
none
of
sellers'
outrageous
hamminess
and
no
slapstick
and
the
absence
of
that
ludic
element
turns
the
script
into
a
somewhat
gloomy
love
story
the
moody
musical
score
helps
keep
it
there
so
does
the
photography
which
is
too
often
dark
foggy
and
rainy
whereas
nabokov's
novel
was
full
of
sunshine
beaches
vast
furrowed
plains
and
craggy
mountains
okay
at
its
base
it's
a
tragedy
we
know
that
but
why
remove
the
one
element
that
makes
it
more
than
that?
i
guess
in
a
way
it
can't
be
helped
hh
was
pretty
snotty
and
contemptuous
of
almost
everyone
he
met
but
that
was
all
internally
edited
by
him
outwardly
he
was
polite
and
a
little
distant
in
a
proper
aristocratic
way
his
demeanor
was
phony
but
deliberately
so
and
the
irony
of
the
contrast
between
his
amused
contempt
and
his
interactional
delicacy
is
gone
i
suppose
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
can
get
there
is
always
so
much
more
to
a
work
of
fiction
than
what
we
see
on
the
screen
at
least
as
far
as
a
classic
work
like
lolita
is
concerned
hitchcock's
movie
of
psycho
was
actually
an
improvement
over
robert
bloch's
unimaginative
story
no
comment
on
those
who
find
the
novel
or
either
film
version
offensive
because
the
story
is
an
endorsement
of
pedophilia
or
because
it
encourages
statutory
rape
or
something

the
