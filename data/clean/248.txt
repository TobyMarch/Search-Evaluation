the
rolling
stones
are
an
english
rock
band
formed
in
london
in
april
1962
by
brian
jones
(guitars
harmonica)
ian
stewart
(piano)
mick
jagger
(vocals
harmonica)
and
keith
richards
(guitars)
bassist
bill
wyman
and
drummer
charlie
watts
completed
the
early
lineup
the
rolling
stones
raised
the
international
regard
for
the
primitive
blues
typified
by
chess
records'
artists
such
as
muddy
waters
who
wrote
the
song
rollin'
stone
after
which
the
band
is
named
rb
and
blues
cover
songs
dominated
the
rolling
stones'
early
material
but
their
repertoire
has
always
included
rock
and
roll
according
to
critic
and
musicologist
robert
palmer
the
rolling
stones
have
endured
and
stayed
relevant
by
remaining
rooted
in
traditional
verities
in
rhythmandblues
and
soul
music
while
more
ephemeral
pop
fashions
have
come
and
gone
jones
initially
led
the
band
but
after
teaming
as
songwriters
jagger
and
richards
assumed
leadership
by
1969
jones'
diminishing
contributions
to
the
band
and
his
inability
to
tour
the
united
states
for
legal
and
health
reasons
led
to
him
leaving
the
band
three
weeks
after
his
departure
jones
drowned
his
immediate
replacement
mick
taylor
stayed
with
the
band
until
1974
and
was
replaced
by
ronnie
wood
wyman
retired
from
the
band
in
1993
and
his
replacement
darryl
jones
is
not
a
full
member
stewart
was
taken
from
the
official
lineup
in
1963
to
continue
as
the
band's
road
manager
and
occasional
keyboardist
until
his
death
in
1985
since
1982
chuck
leavell
has
been
the
band's
primary
keyboardist

grrr!
because
they
are
12
thats
a
clue
rolling
stones
have
done
nothing
to
influence
modern
culture
during
the
life
of
that
12
year
old
are
the
rolling
stones
better
than
today's
rubbish?
of
course
they
are
but
that
is
our
opinion
the
rolling
stones
became
popular
because
the
kids
of﻿
the
60s
were
able
to
reject
what
came
before
and
enjoy
new
music
and
you
want
to
punch
a
12
year
old
of
today
for
doing
the
same??
this
is
music
that
you
like
give
them
the
choice
to
like
dubstep
or
whatever

i
disagree﻿
although
people
today
can
rebel
from
the
music
from
before
they're
not
rebelling
to
music
in
the
60s
people
rebelled
from
one
genre
of
music
to
another
it
was
pretty
much
the
same
instruments
used
in
a
different
format
(strings
vocals
percussion)
today
70%
of
the
music
is
how
it's
edited
it's
based
more
around
the
technology
instead
of
the
talent
the
stones
could
still
play
great
w/o
having
their
music
or
voices
altered
i
don't
think
most
artists
today
could
do
that
