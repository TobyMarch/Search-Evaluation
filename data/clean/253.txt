biography
isle
of
man
uk
(1960
–
2003)
the
bee
gees
originally
made
up
of
three
brothers
barry
gibb
robin
gibb
(died
2012)
and
maurice
gibb
(died
2003)
have
been
successful
for
most
of
their
40plus
years
of
recording
music
they
had
two
distinct
periods
of
exceptional
success
as
a
pop
act
in
the
late
1960s
and
early
1970s
and
as
a
foremost
act
of
the
disco
music
era
in
the
late
1970s
the
gibb
brothers
were
born
on
the
isle
of
man
uk
to
english
parents
in
1946
(barry
alan
crompton
gibb
september
1)
and
1949
(
twins
robin
hugh
gibb
and
maurice
(pronounced
“morris”)
ernest
gibb
december
22)
the
family
returned
to
father
hugh
gibb’s
home
town
of
chorltoncumhardy
manchester
england
in
the
early
1950s
where
the
boys
began
to
sing
in
harmony
debuting
in
public
on
one
memorable
occasion
at
a
local
cinema
the
boys
were
going
to
lip
sync
to
a
record
which
other
children
had
done
at
the
cinema
in
previous
weeks
however
on
the
way
to
the
cinema
the
record
was
dropped
and
broken
as
a
result
the
brothers
got
on
stage
and
sang
themselves
they
got
a
very
good
response
from
the
crowd
which
convinced
them
that
singing
was
what
they
wanted
to
do
with
their
lives
in
1958
the
gibb
family
including
infant
brother
andy
(born
march
5
1958
in
manchester)
emigrated
to
redcliffe
queensland
australia
and
and
went
to
humpybong
state
school
the
still
very
young
brothers
began
performing
where
they
could
to
raise
pocket
