acting
in
1979
madonna
starred
in
lowbudget
feature
a
certain
sacrifice
its
release
in
1985
coincided
with
the
success
of
her
like
a
virgin
album
and
madonna
tried
to
prevent
its
release
that
same
year
madonna
made
a
small
cameo
appearance
as
a
club
singer
in
the
film
vision
quest
singing
crazy
for
you
then
garnered
commercial
and
critical
success
in
susan
seidelman's
desperately
seeking
susan
a
story
of
a
housewife
who
is
fascinated
with
a
woman
she
only
knows
by
reading
messages
in
the
personals
section
of
a
new
york
city
tabloid
it
was
a
commercial
success
and
grossed
$27
million
in
the
united
states
alone[1]
madonna
then
appeared
in
the
adventure
drama
shanghai
surprise
(1986)
with
thenhusband
sean
penn
the
film
was
dismissed
by
moviegoers
and
received
poor
reviews
many
of
them
calling
her
acting
wooden
subsequent
films
such
as
who's
that
girl
(1987)
and
bloodhounds
of
broadway
(1989)
failed
to
attract
commercial
or
critical
success
she
was
the
first
choice
for
the
role
of
susie
diamond
in
the
fabulous
baker
boys
but
famously
rejected
the
part
claiming
it
was
too
mushy[2]
this
proved
to
be
an
unwise
decision
on
her
part
because
the
film
turned
out
to
be
a
boxoffice
success
and
it
brought
michelle
pfeiffer
to
even
greater
fame
in
1990
madonna
received
good
reviews
for
her
turn
as
breathless
mahoney
in
dick
tracy
directed
by
warren
beatty
and
based
on
chester
gould's
comic
strip
beatty
would
later
surface
again
in
the
1991
documentary
madonna
truth
or
dare
(aka
in
bed
with
madonna)
which
showed
the
behind
the
scenes
to
the
1990
blond
ambition
world
tour
in
december
1990
it
was
announced
that
madonna
had
pulled
out
of
the
controversial
jennifer
lynch
film
boxing
helena[3][4]
in
1992
madonna
released
two
movies
the
first
was
a
cameo
appearance
as
a
trapeze
artist
in
woody
allen's
shadows
and
fog
the
black
and
white
film
was
an
homage
to
german
expressionist
cinema
backed
by
the
music
of
kurt
weill
she
also
starred
in
penny
marshall's
a
league
of
their
own
opposite
tom
hanks
geena
davis
and
rosie
o'donnell
the
film
centered
on
a
women's
baseball
team
during
world
war
ii
and
earned
madonna
good
reviews
it
was
a
big
commercial
success
worldwide
especially
in
north
america
following
the
media
backlash
caused
by
her
sex
book
and
its
companion
album
erotica
madonna
starred
in
the
1993
erotic
thriller
body
of
evidence
with
willem
dafoe
and
anne
archer
it
was
panned
by
critics
and
performed
poorly
at
the
box
office
it
caused
great
controversy
in
the
media
due
to
the
explicit
sexual
content
later
that
year
she
starred
in
dangerous
game
opposite
harvey
keitel
and
james
russo
considered
nihilistic
and
violent
it
had
an
extremely
limited
release
in
new
york
and
los
angeles
madonna
did
however
receive
good
reviews
madonna
has
remarked
her
dislike
of
the
end
result
saying
of
the
director
abel
ferrara
he
fucked
me
over

however
i
am
good
in
it
this
was
also
the
first
movie
production
from
madonna's
entertainment
company
maverick
in
1995
madonna
almost
got
the
role
of
the
drug
addicted
ginger
mckenna
in
martin
scorsese's
casino
though
she
had
secured
the
role
she
lost
the
part
at
the
last
minute
to
sharon
stone
who
convinced
scorsese
to
cast
her
instead
madonna
played
a
cameo
singing
telegram
girl
in
wayne
wang's
blue
in
the
face
and
a
witch
in
four
rooms
she
also
made
another
cameo
appearance
as
a
phone
sex
company
owner
in
spike
lee's
girl
6
in
1996
later
that
year
madonna
starred
as
eva
per&oacuten
in
the
film
adaptation
of
the
andrew
lloyd
webber
musical
evita
the
film
marked
the
first
time
in
america
since
desperately
seeking
susan
that
she
was
praised
for
her
acting
madonna
had
campaigned
for
the
role
for
nearly
ten
years
and
in
december
1994
she
wrote
a
fourpage
handwritten
letter
to
director
alan
parker
explaining
that
she
would
be
perfect
to
play
the
role
parker
agreed
and
madonna
took
voice
lessons
to
extend
her
range
and
researched
the
life
of
her
character[5]
in
january
1997
she
won
a
golden
globe
award
for
best
actress
in
a
motion
picture
musical
or
comedy
but
failed
to
receive
a
nomination
at
the
academy
awards
though
the
song
you
must
love
me
won
the
oscar
for
best
song
both
you
must
love
me
and
don't
cry
for
me
argentina
were
hit
singles
madonna's
followup
to
evita
was
another
critically
panned
role
as
abbie

decides
to
have
a
baby

off
strong
on
its
opening
week
with
$15
million
but
this
quickly
diminished
swept
away
followed
in
2002
and
was
another
critical
and
commercial
failure
the
remake
of
an
italian
film
by

wertm&uumlller
in
1975
was
the
first
big
screen
collaboration
between
