cruncher
that

visit
darnay
before
his
imminent
execution

reflects
that
a
human
being
who
has
not
secured
the
love
of
another
has
wasted
his
life
and
lorry
agrees
that
night
as
he
wanders

streets

thinks
of
lucie
he
enters
a
chemist’s
shop
and
buys
a
mysterious
substance
the
words
spoken
by
the
priest
at
his
father’s
funeral
echo
through
his
mind
“i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
saith
the
lord
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
and
whosoever
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
die”
carton
helps
a
small
girl
across
the
muddy
street
and
she
gives
him
a
kiss
the
priest’s
words
echo
again
in
his
mind

wanders
until
sunrise
then
makes
his
way
to
the
courthouse
for
darnay’s
trial
the
judge
names
darnay’s
accusers
the
defarges
and
doctor
manette
manette
reacts
with
shock
and
denies
having
ever
denounced
darnay
defarge
then
takes
the
stand
and
speaks
of
a
letter
that
he
found
hidden
in
105

tower
of
the
bastille

the
substance
of
the
shadow
defarge
claims
that
manette
wrote
the
letter
while
imprisoned
in
the
bastille
and
he
reads
it
aloud
it
tells
the
story
of
manette’s
imprisonment
in
1757
a
pair
of
brothers
one
the
marquis
evr&eacutemonde
(darnay’s
father)
and
the
other
the
next
in
line
to
be
marquis
(darnay’s
uncle
the
man
who
ran
over
the
child
with
his
carriage
in
book
the
second
chapter
7)
ordered
doctor
manette
to
care
for
a
young
peasant
woman
who
was
dying
of
a
fever
and
her
brother
who
was
dying
of
a
stab
wound
the
marquis’
brother
had
raped
the
young
woman
killed
her
husband
and
stabbed
her
brother
who
died
quickly
although
the
woman
was
still
alive
manette
failed
to
save
her
life
the
next
day
a
kind
woman—the
marquis’
wife
and
darnay’s
mother—came
to
manette’s
door
having
heard
about
the
horrible
things
done
to
the
peasant
girl
and
her
family
she
offers
to
help
the
girl’s
sister
who
was
hidden
away
so
the
marquis
could
not
find
her
unfortunately
manette
does
not
know
the
sister’s
whereabouts
the
next
day
manette
was
taken
away
and
imprisoned
in
the
bastille
on
the
orders
of
the
marquis
evr&eacutemonde

this
story

7
announce
the
four
soldiers
come
to
take
darnay
back
to
prison
whereas
the
revolution
only
vaguely
stirs
lucie
when
she
sits
in
her
comfortable
parlor
in
england
it
encroaches
physically
and
emotionally
upon
her
most
intimate
relationships
now
that
she
has
come
to
paris
this
transformation
of
the
revolution
from
an
abstract
notion
into
a
direct
presence
in
the
lives
of
lucie
and
manette
finds
a
parallel
in
the
soldiers’
words
to
them
in
answering
manette’s
question
as
to
the
identity
of
darnay’s
accusers
the
soldiers
first
tell
him
that
they
are
acting
on
the
orders
of
saint
antoine
the
personified
suburb
of
paris
at
the
heart
of
the
revolution
however
manette
soon
learns
that
defarge
and
his
wife
have
in
fact
occasioned
the
arrest
with
the
news
of
this
betrayal
by
his
former
allies
the
revolution
reaches
new
heights
of
personal
significance
for
manette
as
the
novel
approaches
its
close
the
reader
encounters
an
everincreasing
number
of
coincidences
such
as
miss
pross’s
discovery
of
her
longlost
brother
carton’s
timely
arrival
in
the
wine
shop
to
identify
barsad
and
defarge’s
discovery
of
manette’s
letter
denouncing
the
evr&eacutemonde
family
moments
such
as
these
endemic
to
victorian
fiction
constitute
a
device
called
deus
ex
machina
(literally
“god
out
of
the
machine”)
a
term
that
refers
to
improbable
contrivances
used
by
the
author
to
resolve
the
plot
modern
readers
more
accustomed
to
realistic
narratives
usually
consider
such
unlikely
developments
to
reflect
a
weakness
in
the
plot’s
conception
even
in
dickens’s
time
certain
readers
objected
to
the
contrived
feeling
created
by
these
coincidences
wilkie
collins
for
instance—the
author
of
the
frozen
deep
the
play
that
inspired
a
tale
of
two
cities—found
the
discovery
of
manette’s
letter
in
dickens’s
work
highly
unlikely
but
defenders
of
this
style
of
writing
believe
that
dickens
conceived
a
world
in
which
everything
is
so
interconnected
to
everything
else
that
coincidence—no
matter
how
unlikely—is
inevitable
dickens’s
biographer
john
forster
defended
the
author
thus
on
the
coincidences
resemblances
and
surprises
of
life
dickens
liked
especially
to
dwell
and
few
things
moved
his
fancy
so
pleasantly
the
world
he
would
say
was
so
much
smaller
than
we
thought
it
we
were
all
so
connected
by
fate
without
knowing
it
people
supposed
to
be
far
apart
were
so
constantly
elbowing
each
other
and
tomorrow
bore
so
close
a
resemblance
to
nothing
half
so
much
as
to
yesterday
the
coincidences
dickens
presents
may
seem
excessive
in
number
but
many
critics
have
come
to
see
these
plot
devices
as
yet
another
example
of
dickens’s
talent
for
exaggeration
just
as
his
many
caricatured
figures
serve
to
emphasize
and
comment
on
real
human
foibles
his
coincidences
and
sudden
surprising
connections
serve
merely
to
exaggerate
the
frequency
of
what
dickens
believed
to
be
very
real
phenomena
in
our
own
world
regardless
of
how
one
feels
about
carton’s
sudden
appearance
one
must
acknowledge
the
transformation
of
his
character
as
one
of
the
novel’s
foremost
achievements
indeed
carton
proves
the
most
psychologically
complex
and
emotionally
rich
character
that
a
tale
of
two
cities
has
to
offer
by
the
time
of
his
appearance
in
paris
he
has
shed
the
skin
of
“the
jackal”
no
longer
insolent
lazy
and
directionless
he
emerges
determined
to
save
darnay’s
life
for
the
sake
of
the
woman
that
he
himself
loves
he
now
has
a
purpose
and
a
purpose
that
he
cherishes
in
chapter
9
the
reader
witnesses
him
preparing
to
make
the
ultimate
sacrifice
as
he
recites
a
passage
from
the
book
of
john
(1125–26)
in
the
christian
tradition
worshippers
speak
these
lines
at
the
opening
of
the
burial
service
in
the
book
of
common
prayer
carton’s
utterance
of
these
words
has
a
dual
significance
first
his
words
confirm
that
he
has
made
a
conscious
decision
to
give
of
himself
for
lucie’s
sake
(the
reader
might
argue
that
carton
already
has
sacrificed
himself
to
lucie’s
benefit
however
although
carton
has
saved
darnay
once
before
in
book
the
second
chapter
3
this
first
occasion—his
observation
of
the
physical
likeness
that
he
and
darnay
share—seemed
more
serendipitous
than
an
act
of
valor
performed
deliberately
to
help
lucie)
second
carton’s
recitation
of
the
biblical
passage
speaks
beyond
his
personal
psychology
to
the
fates
of
the
other
characters
in
the
novel
promising
a
final
and
satisfying
resurrection
