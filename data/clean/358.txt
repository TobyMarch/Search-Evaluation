the

of
the

is
a
novel
written
by
umberto
eco
in
1980
which
also
received
a
movie
adaptation
in
1986
directed
by
jeanjacques

and
starring
christian
slater
f
murray
abraham
ron
perlman
michael
lonsdale
and
sean

it
is
set
in
what
has
been
called
the
disastrous
fourteenth
century
during
the
period
of
the
medieval
inquisition
the
story
described
by
some
as
sherlock
holmes
in
the
14th
century
follows
brother
william
of
baskerville
and
his
young
friar

adso

go
to
an
abbey
where
a
murder
was
committed
in

to

the
book
is
a
detective
mystery
interwoven
with
500
pages
of
incredible
detail
of
the
religious
and
political
schism
in
the
church
that
is
nearly
inscrutable
to
anyone

(or

anyone
