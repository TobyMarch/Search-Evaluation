someone

room
finally
giving
into
her
guilt
she
hangs
herself
the
police
find
the
island
a
few
days
later
and
are
puzzled
by
the
mystery

they
can't
figure
out
who
killed
everyone
since
there
are
only
bodies
on
the
island
and
no
one
could
have
escaped
it
a
few
weeks
later
a
bottle
is
caught
a
fisherman
inside
it
is
a
confession
written
by
wargrave

it
explains
and
why
he
killed
everyone
his
whole
life
he
had
twin
conflicting
desires

one
for
justice
the
other
to
kill
people
he'd
enjoyed
killing
the
guilty
by
sentencing
them
to
death
in
his
court
but
that
wasn't
good
enough
he
wanted
to
kill
people
himself
once
he
found
that
he
was
dying
of
cancer
he
decided
to
go
through
with
it
he
found
nine
guilty
people
and
lured
them
to
the
island
then
murdered
them
one
by
one
using
armstrong
to
help
fake
his
death
so
that
he
wouldn't
be
a
suspect
once
everyone
was
dead
he
arranged
to
kill
himself
so
that
it
would
look
like
his
fake
death

so
the
police
would
be
confused
by
an
unsolvable
crime
lastly
he
sealed
up
his
confession
in
a
bottle
and
threw
it
out
to
sea
because
he
couldn't
bear
the
thought
of
no
one
ever
knowing
about
how
brilliant
he
