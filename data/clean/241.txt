without
doubt
my
favourite
album
out
of
them
all
my
earliest
memories
of
celine
are
listeninig
to
the
power
of
love
and
think
twice
i
was
very
young
when
that
album
came
out
but
i
still
have
the
original
one
that
was
bought
for
me
and
not
a
scratch
on
it

this
album
is
a
temporary
goodbye
from
celine
i
really
remember
when
this
cd
is
put
on
the
store
the
cd
cover
is
directly
recognizable
from
afar
about
the
songs?
the
new
songs
is
really2x
good
some
say
that
new
songs
cannot
beat
the
9
hits
(from
power
of
love
until
i'm
your
angel)
on
this
album
and
a
downhill
starting
from
i'm
your
angel
i'll
say
different
from
that's
the
way
it
is
until
live
for
the
one
you
love
has
its
character
that's
the
way
it
is
then
you
look
at
me
i
want
you
to
need
me
is
really2
powerful
if
walls
could
talk
live
for
the
one
you
love
the
first
time
ever
i
saw
your
face
and
all
the
way
is
really2x
haunting
the
videos
of
the
new
songs
is
also
great
to
see
i
really2x
like
that's
the
way
it
is
video
and
also
if
you
can
find
the
remix
from
that's
the
way
it
is
(metro
club
mix)
and
also
i
want
you
to
need
me
(thunderpuss
remix)
they
both
are
also
good
remixes
but
i
never
see
celine
perform
most
of
this
new
songs
live
i
already
saw
that's
the
way
it
islive
version
from
david
foster
world's
children
day
concert
and
also
celine
millenium
concert
the
first
time
ever
i
saw
your
face
and
all
the
way
can
be
seen
from
a
new
day
dvd
but
the
others?
i
think
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
for
example
if
walls
could
talk
or
live
for
the
one
i
love

live
for
the
very
first
time
what
do
you
think?
