by
now
you
undoubtedly
know
that
adrian
lyne's
film
version
of
vladimir
nabokov's
lolita
received
its
much
belated
american
debut
on
august
2nd
on
showtime
and
will
be
released
in
theaters
next
month
you
very
likely
also
know
that
the
movie
was
well
not
exactly
banned
but
effectively
so
by
the
refusal
of
american
film
distributors
to
participate
in
its
release
and
you
probably
have
a
sense
of
what
the
fuss
was
all
about
the
film
is
reportedly
too
racy
for
american
eyes
but
there's
a
very
different
angle
on
this
story
to
be
found
through
a
closer
look
at
the
novel
nabokov's
lolita
was
originally
published
in
1955
and
immediately
became
embroiled
in
its
own
censorship
battles
the
story
is
admittedly
purposefully
a
shocking
one
humbert
humbert
an
emigr&eacute
academic
has
a
thing
for
young
girls
nymphets
he
calls
them
prepubescent
girls
who
betray
some
precocious
awareness
of
their
own
sensuality
upon
accepting
a
position
at
a
new
college
humbert
rents
a
room
in
town
and
falls
madly
passionately
horrifyingly
in
love
with
his
landlady's
12yearold
daughter
dolores
haze
the
lolita
of
the
novel's
title
he
marries
dolores's
mother
in
order
to
maintain
proximity
to
dolores
herself
and
his
relationship
with
her
very
quickly
exceeds
the
bounds
of
stepfatherly
affection
there
are
several
upsetting
things
about
this
story
not
the
least
of
which
is
that
it
appears
lolita
herself
is
the
seducer
and
humbert
the
seducee
hence
the
ubiquitous
comparisons
of
any
precociously
sexual
slightly
dangerous
girl
to
this
character
(for
example
the
long
island
lolita)
these
comparisons

and
the
moral
censorship
to
which
the
novel
has
been
subject

are
however
based
on
a
most
superficial
reading
of
the
book
one
that
overlooks
a
basic
literary
concept
the
unreliable
narrator
humbert
humbert
is
the
one
who
tells
us
the
story
from
an
insane
asylum
he's
a
child
molester
and
ultimately
a
murderer
why
on
earth
should
we
take
his
word
for
how
it
happened?
this
in
fact
is
the
real
story
of
lolita
the
novel
is
about
the
ways
in
which
a
reader
can
be
manipulated
to
feel
sympathy
for

even
to
identify
with

the
most
horrifying
person
imaginable
that
early
readers
of
the
novel
were
so
shocked
by
dolores's
behavior

so
shocked
in
fact
that
governments
moved
to
ban
the
book

is
precisely
nabokov's
point
rather
than
acknowledge
the
ultimate
evil
that
lies
under
the
otherwise
charming
persona
we
as
a
culture
are
more
inclined
to
turn
him
into
a
tragic
hero
a
victim
lolita
was
of
course
filmed
years
ago
by
stanley
kubrick
nabokov
wrote
a
screenplay
for
the
movie
that
was
ultimately
cast
aside
the
kubrick
film
is
quirky
almost
to
a
fault
nabokov
himself
reportedly
said
that
he
liked
the
movie
quite
a
lot
though
it
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
his
novel
kubrick
managed
to
evade
at
least
some
of
the
moral
terror
surrounding
his
subject
by
casting
sue
lyons
as
dolores
lyons
was
16
when
the
film
was
shot
a
slightly
too
young
woman
rather
than
a
child
adrian
lyne
has
left
himself
no
such
comfort
zone
while
in
london
earlier
this
summer
i
happily
got
a
chance
to
see
the
new
film
and
form
my
own
opinions
the
first
of
which
is
this
dominique
swain
is
stunning
as
dolores
one
moment
a
seductress
and
the
very
next
a
gawky
child
and
jeremy
irons's
humbert
is
passionate
and
terrifying
the
film
is
lushly
beautifully
shot

uncomfortably
so
at
moments

and
quite
faithful
to
the
novel
at
least
to
what
the
novel
claims
to
say
what
humbert
says
it
says
but
the
film
misses
unfortunately
exactly
what
the
critics
all
along
have
missed
humbert
humbert
is
not
to
be
trusted
this
is
i
suspect
one
of
the
fundamental
differences
in
narrative
possibility
between
the
novel
and
film
one
that
makes
any
complete
adaptation
of
lolita
all
but
impossible
film
really
has
no
equivalent
to
the
unreliable
narrator
some
films
do
experiment
with
multiple
perspectives

see
for
instance
kurosawa's
rashomon

and
so
manage
to
cast
doubt
on
any
sense
of
truth
more
recently
the
opposite
of
sex
presents
a
thoroughly
untrustworthy
narrator
but
one
who
happily
tells
the
audience
when
she's
lying
but
the
puzzle
presented
by
a
narrator
as
charming
and
horrible
as
humbert
humbert
is
perhaps
one
that
can
only
be
appreciated
through
the
novel
nabokov
plays
repeatedly
throughout
his
novels
with
such
narrative
puzzles
pale
fire
for
instance
presents
itself
as
the
definitive
annotated
edition
of
the
last
poem
of
the
late
john
shade
with
commentary
by
his
faithful
friend
charles
kinbote
but
the
commentary
has
far
more
to
do
with
kinbote
than
it
does
with
shade's
poem
and
ultimately
reveals
that
kinbote
may
not
be
at
all
who
he
claims
to
be
and
may
in
fact
not
be
the
identity
he's
hiding
either
pnin
is
the
thirdperson
story
of
a
befuddled
russian
academic
whose
perceptions
of
reality
seem
more
than
a
little
skewed
ada
or
ardor
is
the
ultimate
family
romance
a
philosophical
treatise
posing
as
a
novel
annotated
by
vivian
darkbloom
(an
anagram
of
vladimir
nabokov
and
a
character
who
receives
brief
mention
in
lolita)
and
despair
is
literally
as
all
of
nabokov's
novels
are
figuratively
a
mystery
these
mysteries
are
the
heart
of
nabokov's
writing
and
though
lolita
appears
a
straightforward
story
the
reader
should
always
be
wary
my
recommendations
about
lolita
see
the
film
it's
beautiful
it's
compelling
and
it's
important
but
more
to
the
point
read
the
novel
if
you've
never
read
it
i
envy
you
the
joys
of
your
first
encounter
with
it
if
you've
read
it
before
read
it
again
it
offers
up
something
new
each
time
as
do
all
of
nabokov's
intricate
puzzles
each
text
begs
you
to
take
it
apart
look
at
it
from
the
other
side
figure
out
where
the
truth
might
actually
lie
—kathleen
fitzpatrick
elizabeth
janeway
[lolita's]
illicit
nature
will
both
shock
the
reader
into
paying
attention
and
prevent
sentimentally
false
sympathy
from
distorting
his
judgment
contrariwise
i
believe
mr
nabokov
is
slyly
exploiting
the
american
emphasis
on
the
attraction
of
youth
and
the
importance
devoted
to
the
“teenager”
in
order
to
promote
an
unconscious
identification
with
humbert’s
agonies
both
techniques
are
entirely
valid
but
neither
i
hope
will
obscure
the
purpose
of
the
device
namely
to
underline
the
essential
inefficient
painstaking
and
paingiving
selfishness
of
all
passion
all
greed—of
all
urges
whatever
they
may
be
that
insist
on
being
satisfied
without
regard
to
the
effect
their
satisfaction
has
upon
the
outside

taken
advantage

it

school
a

miles
from

and
there
i
played

and
got
excellent
marks
and
was
on
perfect
terms
with
schoolmates
and
teachers
alike

only
definite
sexual
events
that
i
can
remember
as
having
occurred
before

thirteenth
birthday
(that

little
annabel)

of

had

from

in
the
hotel
library
later
in
his
delightful
debonair
manner
my
father
gave
me
all
the
information
he
thought
i
needed
about
sex
this
was
just
before
sending
me
in
the
autumn
of
1923
to
a
lyc&eacutee
in
lyon
(where
we
were
to
spend
three
winters)
but
alas
in
the
summer
of
that
year
he
was
touring
italy
with
mme
de
r
and
her
daughter
and
i
had
nobody
to
complain
to
nobody
to
consult

annabel
was
like
the
writer
of
mixed
parentage
halfenglish
halfdutch
in
her
case
i
remember
her
features
far
less
distinctly
today
than
i
did
a
few
years
ago
before
i
knew
lolita
there
are
two
kinds
of
visual
memory
one
when
you
skillfully
recreate
an
image
in
the
laboratory
of
your
mind
with
your
eyes
open
(and
then
i
see
annabel
in
such
general
terms
as
honeycolored
skin
thin
arms
brown
bobbed
hair
long
lashes
big
bright
mouth)
and
the
other
when
you
instantly
evoke
with
shut
eyes
on
the
dark
innerside
of
your
eyelids
the
objective
absolutely
optical
replica
of
a
beloved
face
a
little
ghost
in
natural
colors
(and
this
is
how
i
see
lolita)
let
me
therefore
primly
limit
myself
in
describing
annabel
to
saying
she
was
a
lovely
child
a
few
months
my
junior
her
parents
were
old
friends
of
my
aunt's
and
as
stuffy
as
she
they
had
rented
a
villa
not
far
from
hotel
mirana
bald
brown
mr
leigh
and
fat
powdered
mrs
leigh
(born
vanessa
van
ness)
how
i
loathed
them!
at
first
annabel
and
i
talked
of
peripheral
affairs
she
kept
lifting
handfuls
of
fine
sand
and
letting
it
pour
through
her
fingers
our
brains
were
turned
the
way
those
of
intelligent
european
preadolescents
were
in
our
day
and
set
and
i
doubt
if
much
individual
genius
should
be
assigned
to
our
interest
in
the
plurality
of
inhabited
worlds
competitive
tennis
infinity
solipsism
and
so
on
the
softness
and
fragility
of
baby
animals
caused
us
the
same
intense
pain
she
wanted
to
be
a
nurse
in
some
famished
asiatic
country
i
wanted
to
be
a
famous
spy
all
at
once
we
were
madly
clumsily
shamelessly
agonizingly
in
love
with
each
other
hopelessly
i
should
add
because
that
frenzy
of
mutual
possession
might
have
been
assuaged
only
by
our
actually
imbibing
and
assimilating
every
particle
of
each
other's
soul
and
flesh
but
there
we
were
unable
even
to
mate
as
slum
children
would
have
so
easily
found
an
opportunity
to
do
after
one
wild
attempt
we
made
to
meet
at
night
in
her
garden
(of
which
more
later)
the
only
privacy
we
were
allowed
was
to
be
out
of
earshot
but
not
out
of
sight
on
the
populous
part
of
the
plage
there
on
the
soft
sand
a
few
feet
away
from
our
elders
we
would
sprawl
all
morning
in
a
petrified
paroxysm
of
desire
and
take
advantage
of
every
blessed
quirk
in
space
and
time
to
touch
each
other
her
hand
halfhidden
in
the
sand
would
creep
toward
me
its
slender
brown
fingers
sleepwalking
nearer
and
nearer
then
her
opalescent
knee
would
start
on
a
long
cautious
journey
sometimes
a
chance
rampart
built
by
younger
children
granted
us
sufficient
concealment
to
graze
each
other's
salty
lips
these
incomplete
contacts
drove
our
healthy
and
inexperienced
young
bodies
to
such
a
state
of
exasperation
that
not
even
the
cold
blue
water
under
which
we
still
clawed
at
each
other
could
bring
relief
among
some
treasures
i
lost
during
the
wanderings
of
my
adult
years
there
was
a
snapshot
taken
by
my
aunt
which
showed
annabel
her
parents
and
the
staid
elderly
lame
gentleman
a
dr
cooper
who
that
same
summer
courted
my
aunt
grouped
around
a
table
in
a
sidewalk
caf&eacute
annabel
did
not
come
out
well
caught
as
she
was
in
the
act
of
bending
over
her
chocolat
glac?
and
her
thin
bare
shoulders
and
the
parting
in
her
hair
were
about
all
that
could
be
identified
(as
i
remember
that
picture)
amid
the
sunny
blur
into
which
her
lost
loveliness
graded
but
i
sitting
somewhat
apart
from
the
rest
came
out
with
a
kind
of
dramatic
conspicuousness
a
moody
beetlebrowed
boy
in
a
dark
sport
shirt
and
welltailored
white
shorts
his
legs
crossed
sitting
in
profile
looking
away
that
photograph
was
taken
on
the
last
day
of
our
fatal
summer
and
just
a
few
minutes
before
we
made
our
second
and
final
attempt
to
thwart
fate
under
the
flimsiest
of
pretexts
(this
was
our
very
last
chance
and
nothing
really
mattered)
we
escaped
from
the
caf?
to
the
beach
and
found
a
desolate
stretch
of
sand
and
there
in
the
violet
shadow
of
some
red
rocks
forming
a
kind
of
cave
had
a
brief
session
of
avid
caresses
with
somebody's
lost
pair
of
sunglasses
for
only
witness
i
was
on
my
knees
and
on
the
point
of
possessing
my
darling
when
two
bearded
bathers
the
old
man
of
the
sea
and
his
brother
came
out
of
the
sea
with
exclamations
of
ribald
encouragement
and
four
months
later
she
died
of
typhus
in
corfu
4
i
leaf
again
and
again
through
these
miserable
memories
and
keep
asking
myself
was
it
then
in
the
glitter
of
that
remote
summer
that
the
rift
in
my
life
began
or
was
my
excessive
desire
for
that
child
only
the
first
evidence
of
an
inherent
singularity?
when
i
try
to
analyze
my
own
cravings
motives
actions
and
so
forth
i
surrender
to
a
sort
of
retrospective
imagination
which
feeds
the
analytic
faculty
with
boundless
alternatives
and
which
causes
each
visualized
route
to
fork
and
refork
without
end
in
the
maddeningly
complex
prospect
of
my
past
i
am
convinced
however
that
in
a
certain
magic
and
fateful
way
lolita
began
with
annabel
i
also
know
that
the
shock
of
annabel's
death
consolidated
the
frustration
of
that
nightmare
summer
made
of
it
a
permanent
obstacle
to
any
further
romance
throughout
the
cold
years
of
my
youth
the
spiritual
and
the
physical
had
been
blended
in
us
with
a
perfection
that
must
remain
incomprehensible
to
the
matteroffact
crude
standardbrained
youngsters
of
today
long
after
her
death
i
felt
her
thoughts
floating
through
mine
long
before
we
met
we
had
had
the
same
dreams
we
compared
notes
we
found
strange
affinities
the
same
june
of
the
same
year
(1919)
a
stray
canary
had
fluttered
into
her
house
and
mine
in
two
widely
separated
countries
oh
lolita
had
you
loved
me
thus!
i
have
reserved
for
the
conclusion
of
my
annabel
phase
the
account
of
our
unsuccessful
first
tryst
one
night
she
managed
to
deceive
the
vicious
vigilance
of
her
family
in
a
nervous
and
slenderleaved
mimosa
grove
at
the
back
of
their
villa
we
found
a
perch
on
the
ruins
of
a
low
stone
wall
through
the
darkness
and
the
tender
trees
we
could
see
the
arabesques
of
lighted
windows
which
touched
up
by
the
colored
inks
of
sensitive
memory
appear
to
me
now
like
playing
cardspresumably
because
a
bridge
game
was
keeping
the
enemy
busy
she
trembled
and
twitched
as
i
kissed
the
corner
of
her
parted
lips
and
the
hot
lobe
of
her
ear
a
cluster
of
stars
palely
glowed
above
us
between
the
silhouettes
of
long
thin
leaves
that
vibrant
sky
seemed
as
naked
as
she
was
under
her
light
frock
i
saw
her
face
in
the
sky
strangely
distinct
as
if
it
emitted
a
faint
radiance
of
its
own
her
legs
her
lovely
live
legs
were
not
too
close
together
and
when
my
hand
located
what
it
sought
a
dreamy
and
eerie
expression
halfpleasure
halfpain
came
over
those
childish
features
she
sat
a
little
higher
than
i
and
whenever
in
her
solitary
ecstasy
she
was
led
to
kiss
me
her
head
would
bend
with
a
sleepy
soft
drooping
movement
that
was
almost
woeful
and
her
bare
knees
caught
and
compressed
my
wrist
and
slackened
again
and
her
quivering
mouth
distorted
by
the
acridity
of
some
mysterious
potion
with
a
sibilant
intake
of
breath
came
near
to
my
face
she
would
try
to
relieve
the
pain
of
love
by
first
roughly
rubbing
her
dry
lips
against
mine
then
my
darling
would
draw
away
with
a
nervous
toss
of
her
hair
and
then
again
come
darkly
near
and
let
me
feed
on
her
open
mouth
while
with
a
generosity
that
was
ready
to
offer
her
everything
my
heart
my
throat
my
entrails
i
gave
her
to
hold
in
her
awkward
fist
the
scepter
of
my
passion
i
recall
the
scent
of
some
kind
of
toilet
powderi
believe
she
stole
it
from
her
mother's
spanish
maida
sweetish
lowly
musky
perfume
it
mingled
with
her
own
biscuity
odor
and
my
senses
were
suddenly
filled
to
the
brim
a
sudden
commotion
in
a
nearby
bush
prevented
them
from
overflowingand
as
we
draw
away
from
each
other
and
with
aching
veins
attended
to
what
was
probably
a
prowling
cat
there
came
from
the
house
her
mother's
voice
calling
her
with
a
rising
frantic
noteand
dr
cooper
ponderously
limped
out
into
the
garden
but
that
mimosa
grovethe
haze
of
stars
the
tingle
the
flame
the
honeydew
and
the
ache
remained
with
me
and
that
little
girl
with
her
seaside
limbs
and
ardent
tongue
haunted
me
ever
sinceuntil
at
last
twentyfour
years
later
i
broke
her
spell
by
incarnating
her
in
another
5
the
days
of
my
youth
as
i
look
back
on
them
seem
to
fly
away
from
me
in
a
flurry
of
pale
repetitive
scraps
like
those
morning
snow
storms
of
used
tissue
paper
that
a
train
passenger
sees
whirling
in

were
meticulous
and
intense
although
not
particularly
fruitful
at
first
i
planned
to
take
a

in

as
many

i
was
even
more
manqu?
than

peculiar

i

so

sat
with

in
the

i
published
tortuous
essays
in
obscure
journals
i
composed
pastiches
foreward
this
is
a
story
that
many
people
imagine
they
will
find
distasteful
especially
in
these
days
where
the
subject
of
pedophilia
is
so
much
in
the
public
consciousness
i
believe
however
that
it
has
a
place
both
as
a
piece
of
literature
and
as
a
film
script
in
today's
society
if
we
cannot
understand
human
behavior
then
how
can
we
change
it?
how
can
we
judge
it?
how
can
we
educate
our
children
about
it?
the
scope
of
nabokov's
story
is
as
much
about
his
relationship
as
a
european
with
this
new
young
exciting
country
of
america
humbert
humbert
a
rather
weak
and
misguided
man
steps
outside
our
society's
morality
and
for
that
he
is
punished
there
are
many
levels
on
which
to
view
the
film
this
script
is
merely
the
map
of
the
film's
landscape
it
is
a
film
which
i
believe
should
rest
among
the
best
of
american
cinema
it
should
be
judged
for
what
it
is
by
a
mature
audience
art
and
i
include
cinema
in
that
should
make
us
question
and
test
our
values
and
make
us
understand

they

with
ways

novel
that
has

lolita
begins
with
an
earnest
foreword
purportedly
written
by
one
john
ray
jr
phd
author
of
do
the
senses
make
sense?
(whose
initials
jr
jr
echo
as
suspiciously
as
humbert
humbert)
why
might
nabokov
have
chosen
to
frame
his
novel
in
this
fashion?
what
is
the
effect
of
knowing
that
the
narrative's
three
main
characters
are
already
deadand
in
a
sense
nonexistent
since
their
names
have
been
changed?
2
why
might
nabokov
have
chosen
to
name
his
protagonist
humbert
humbert?
does
the
name's
parodic
double
rumble
end
up
distancing
us
from
its
owner's
depravity?
is
it
harder
to
take
evil
seriously
when
it
goes
under
an
outlandish
name?
what
uses
comic
and
poetic
does
nabokov
make
of
this
name
in
the
course
of
lolita?
3
humbert's
confession
is
written
in
an
extraordinary
language
it
is
by
turns
colloquial
and
archaic
erudite
and
stilted
florid
and
sardonic
it
is
studded
with
french
expressions
puns
in
several
other
languages
and
allusions
to
authors
from
petrarch
to
joyce
is
this
language
merely
an
extension
of
nabokov's
ownwhich
the
critic
michael
wood
describes
as
a
fabulous
freaky
singing
acrobatic
unheardof
english
(michael
wood

magician's
doubts
nabokov
and
the
risks
of
fictionprinceton
princeton
university

p
5)
or
is
humbert's
language
appropriate
to
his
circumstances
and
motives?
in
what
way
does
it
obfuscate
as
much
as
it
reveals?
and
if
humbert's
prose
is
indeed
a
veil
at
what
points
is
this
veil
lifted
and
what
do
we
glimpse
behind
it?
4
humbert
attributes
his
pedophilia
(or
nympholepsy)
to
his
tragically
aborted
childhood
romance
with
annabel
leigh
how
far
can
we
trust
this
explanation?
how
do
we
reconcile
humbert's
reliance
on
the
freudian
theory
of
psychic
trauma
with
his
corrosive
disdain
for
psychiatrists?
5
in
the
early
stages
of
his
obsession
humbert
sees
lolita
merely
as
a
new
incarnation
of
annabel
even
making
love
to
her
on
different
beaches
as
he
tries
to
symbolically
consummate
his
earlier
passion
in
what
other
ways
does
humbert
remain
a
prisoner
of
the
past?
does
he
ever
succeed
in
escaping
it?
why
is
lolita
singularly
impervious
to
the
past
to
the
extent
that
she
can
even
shrug
off
the
abuse
inflicted
on
her
by
both
humbert
and
quilty?
6
how
does
humbert's
marriage
to
valeria
foreshadow
his
relationships
with
both
charlotte
and
lolita?
how
does
the
revelation
of
valeria's
infidelity
prepare
us
for
lolita's
elopement
with
quilty?
why
does
humbert
respond
so
differently
to
these
betrayals?
7
on
page
31
we
encounter
the
first
of
the
dazzling
coincidences
that
illuminate
lolita
like
flashes
of
lightning
(or
perhaps
stage
lightning)
when
humbert
flips
through
a
copy
of
who's
who
in
the
limelight
in
the
prison
library
what
is
the
significance
of
each
of
the
entries
for
roland
pym
clare
quilty
and
dolores
quine
in
what
ways
do
their
names
biographies
and
credits
prefigure
the
novel's
subsequent
developments?
who
is
the
mysterious
vivian
darkbloom
whose
name
is
an
anagram
for
vladimir
nabokov?
where
else
in
lolita
does
nabokov
provide
us
with
imaginary
texts
that
seem
to
lend
verisimilitude
to
humbert's
narrative
and
at
the
same
time
make
us
question
the
factuality
of
the
world
in
which
it
is
set?
8
humbert
humbert
is
an
&eacutemigr&eacute
not
only
has
he
left
europe
for
america
but
in
the
course
of
lolita
he
becomes
an
erotic
refugee
fleeing
the
stability
of
ramsdale
and
beardsley
for
a
life
in
motel
rooms
and
highway
rest
stops
how
does
this
fact
shape
his
responses
to
the
book's
other
characters
and
their
responses
to
him?
to
what
extent
is
the
america
of
lolita
an
exile's
america?
in
what
ways
is
humbert's
foreignness
a
corollary
of
his
perversion?
is
it
possible
to
see
lolita
as
nabokov's
veiled
meditation
on
his
own
exile?
9
we
also
learn
that
humbert
is
madmad
enough
at
least
to
have
been
committed
to
several
mental
institutions
where
he
took
great
pleasure
in
misleading
his
psychiatrists
is
humbert's
madness
an
aspect
of
his
sexual
deviance
or
is
it
something
more
fundamental?
can
we
trust
a
story
told
by
an
insane
narrator?
what
is
humbert's
kinship
with
the
mad
narrators
of
such
works
as
dostoyevsky's
notes
from
underground
and
gogol's
diary
of
a
madman?
10
what
makes
charlotte
haze
so
repugnant
to
humbert?
does
the
author
appear
to
share
humbert's
antagonism?
does
he
ever
seem
to
criticize
it?
in
what
ways
does
charlotte
embody
the
russian
word
poshlust
which
nabokov
translated
as
not
only
the
obviously
trashy
but
also
the
falsely
important
the
falsely
beautiful
the
falsely
clever
the
falsely
attractive?

the

the

of

note
the

numerous
allusions
to
fairy
tales
and
spells
the
proliferation
of
names
like
elphinstone
pisky
and
the
enchanted
hunters
as
well
as
humbert's
repeated
sightings
of
moths

also
note
that
nabokov
was
a
passionate
lepidopterist
who
identified
and
named
at
least
one
new
species
of
butterfly
how
does
the
character
of
lolita
combine
mythology
and
entomology?
in
what
ways
does
lolita
resemble
both
an
elf
and
an
insect?
what
are
some
of
this
novel's
themes
of
enchantment
and
metamorphosis
as
they
apply
both
to
lolita
and
humbert
and
perhaps
to
the
reader
as
well?
12
before
humbert
actually
beds
his
nymphet
there
is
an
extraordinary
scene
at
once
rhapsodic
repulsive
and
hilarious
in
which
humbert
excites
himself
to
sexual
climax
while
a
(presumably)
unaware
lolita
wriggles
in
his
lap
how
is
this
scene
representative
of
their
ensuing
relationship?
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
sentence
lolita
had
been
safely
solipsized
[p
60]
solipsism
being
the
epistemological
theory
that
the
self
is
the
sole
arbiter
of
reality?
is
all
of
lolita
the
monologue
of
a
pathological
solipsist
who
is
incapable
of
imagining
any
reality
but
his
own
or
of
granting
other
people
any
existence
outside
his
own
desires?
13
can
humbert
ever
be
said
to
love
lolita?
does
he
ever
perceive
her
as
a
separate
being?
is
the
reader
ever
permitted
to
see
her
in
ways
that
humbert
cannot?

these
are
just
a
few
of
the
coincidences
that
make
lolita
so
profoundly
unsettling
why
might
nabokov
deploy
coincidence
so
liberally
in
this
book?
does
he
use
it
as
a
convenient
way
of
advancing
plot
or
in
order
to
call
the
entire
notion
of
a
realistic
narrative
into
question?
how
do
nabokov's
games
of
coincidence
tie
in
with
his
use
of
literary
allusion
(see
questions
4

and
selfreference
(see

quilty

appearance
at

enchanted
hunters
just
before
humbert
beds
lolita
for
the
first
time
yet
rumors
and
allusions
precede
him
does
the
revelation
of
quilty's
identity
come
as
a
surprise?
is
it
the
true
climax
of
lolita?
how
does
nabokov
prepare
us
for
this
revelation?
since
the
mystery
of
quilty's
identity
turns
this
novel
into
a
kind
of
detective
story
(in
which
the
protagonist
is
both
detective
and
criminal)
it
may
be
useful
to
compare
lolita
to
other
examples
of
the
genre
such
as
poe's
the
purloined
letter
arthur
conan
doyle's
sherlock
holmes
stories
or
agatha
christie's
a
murder
is
announced
all
of
which
are
alluded
to
in
the
text
17
among
our
early
clues
about
quilty
is
his
resemblance
to
humbert
(or
humbert's
resemblance
to
him)
this
resemblance
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
lolita
finds
her
mother's
boarder
attractive
and
we
are
reminded
of
it
later
on
when
humbert
believes
for
a
brief
time
that
quilty
may
be
his
uncle
trapp
how
does
quilty
conform
to
the
archetype
of
the
double
or
doppelg&aumlnger?
in
its
literary
incarnations
a
double
may
represent
the
protagonist's
evil
underself
or
his
higher
nature
what
sort
of
double
is
quilty?
are
we
ever
given
the
impression
that
humbert
may
be
quilty's
double?
18
if
we
accept
humbert
at
his
word
lolita
initiates
their
first
sexual
encounter
seducing
him
after
he
has
balked
at
violating
her
in
her
sleep
yet
later
humbert
admits
that
lolita
sobbed
in
the
nightevery
night
every
nightthe
moment
i
feigned
sleep
[p
176]
should
we
read
this
reversal
psychologically
that
what
began
as
a
game
for
lolita
has
now
become
a
terrible
and
inescapable
reality?
or
has
humbert
been
lying
to
us
from
the
first?
what
is
the
true
nature
of
the
crimes
committed
against
lolita?
does
humbert
ever
genuinely
repent
them
or
is
even
his
remorse
a
sham?
does
lolita
forgive
humbert
or
only
forget
him?
19
humbert
is
not
only
lolita's
debaucher
but
her
stepfather
and
after
charlotte's
death
the
closest
thing
she
has
to
a
parent
what
kind
of
parent
is
he?
how
does
his
behavior
toward
the
girl
increasingly
come
to
resemble
charlotte's?
why
during
their
last
meeting
does
lolita
dismiss
the
erotic
aspect
of
their
relationship
and
grant
only
that
humbert
was
a
good
father?
20
as
previously
mentioned
lolita
abounds
with
games
the
games
humbert
plays
with
his
psychiatrists
his
games
of
chess
with
gaston
godin
the
transcontinental
games
of
tag
and
hideandgoseek
that
quilty
plays
with
humbert
and
the
slapstick
game
of
quilty's
murder
there
is
humbert's
poignant
outburst
i
have
only
words
to
play
with!
[p
32]
in
what
way
does
this
novel
itself
resemble
a
vast
and
intricate
game
a
game
played
with
words?
is
nabokov
playing
with
his
readers
or
against
them?
how
does
such
an
interpretation
alter
your
experience
of
lolita?
do
its
gamelike
qualities
detract
from
its
emotional
seriousness
or
actually
heighten
it?
21
the
last
lines
of
lolita
are
i
am
thinking
of
aurochs
and
angels
the
secret
of
durable
pigments
prophetic
sonnets
the
refuge
of
art
and
this
is
the
only
immortality
you
and
i
may
share
my
lolita
[p
309]
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
passage?
what
does
art
offer
humbert
and
his
beloved
that
sexual
passion
cannot?
is
this
aesthetic
appeal
merely
the
mask
with
which
humbert
conceals
or
justifies
his
perversion
or
is
the
immortality
of
art
the
thing
that
humbert
and
his
creator
have
been
seeking
all
along?
in
what
ways
is
lolita
at
once
a
meditation
on
and
a
recreation
of
the
artistic
process?

the
wondrous
paradox
of
lolita
i
picked
up
this
bookalready
in
love
with
the
prose
of
vladimir
nabokovand
i
find
almost
every
main
character
disgusting
vile
almost
inhuman
but
i
could
not
put
the
book
down
the
beauty
of
the
writing
the
rhythmic
flow
of
the
descriptions
the
tender
gestures
of
the
nymphet
dolores
haze
the
subtlties
of
nabokov's
aliteration
the
fluidness
of
instances
the
sheer
ability
to
run
rapidly
through
dozens
and
dozens
of
scenes
while
keeping
us
'or
shall
i
say
dear
reader!'
envisioned
with
humbert
and
his
escapades
around
the
america
vistas
the
paradox
is
here
we
have
a
book
that
revolts
me
in
every
physical
way
but
the
style
the
rhythm
the
cadence
the
damn
confidence!
of
nabokov
is
enough
to
make
me
read
on
about
our
dear
monster
and
his
lolita!

good
summer
read!
lolita
is
a
twisted
story
of
lust
and
adoration
humbert
humbert
becomes
obsessed
with
his
landlord's
daughter
out
of
some
similarity
to
his
childhood
lover
he
then
marries
his
landlord
mrs
haze
in
order
to
stay
close
to
her
daughter
dolores
the
nymphet
after
finding
out
about
humbert's
lust
for
her
daughter
mrs
haze
is
killed
when
she
runs
out
of
her
house
in
hysterics
and
is
struck
by
a
car
the
rest
of
the
book
proceeds
with
humbert
and
lolita's
travels
across
america
the
book
is
from
humbert's
perspective
and
gives
the
reader
some
insight
into
the
mind
of
a
pedophile
humbert
prohibits
her
from
having
a
normal
childhood
perhaps
because
she
is
not
a
normal
child
the
reader
understands
his
lust
for
this
particular
young
girl
even
though
humbert's
obsession
with
lolita
is
perverse
it
is
still
tragic
when
he
loses
her
to
another
pedophile
the
reader
actually
feels
sorry
for
humbert
the
truly
pathetic
character
that
he
is
lolita
is
a
very
interesting
book
and
nabokov
wrote
it
well
it
is
by
no
means
a
comedy
yet
in
all
the
drama
of
humbert
and
lolita's
illicit
affair
i
leave
out
love
because
by
no
means
did
she
feel
that
towards
him
the
situations
with
mrs
haze
do
supply
some
comic
relief
to
an
altogether
catastrophic
story
i
chose
this
book
because
it
is
a
classic
and
i
feel
the
need
to
read
the
classics
there
were
parts
of
this
book
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
novel
has
all
the
makings
of
a
great
story
for
it
includes
all
the
components
love
hate
death
sexuality
deceit
and
violence
which
altogether
make
lolita
very
absorbing
however
there
are
slow
parts
with
continuous
descriptions
that
seem
to
go
on
for
pages
these
detailed
descriptions
left
me
bored
for
some
time
as
i
read
i
did
enjoy
the
story
line
and
i
found
the
situation
these
two
characters
found
themselves
in
fascinating
i
sometimes
got
stuck
in
the
slow
parts
and
felt
uninspired
to
continue
i
would
recommend
lolita
to
someone
as
long
as
they
are
prepared
for
what
is
in

intrigue

also
recommend
difficult

read
this
in
high
school
and
it
took
a
while
to
interpret
and

everything
that

don't

to
anyone
that
is
not

who
has

it
is
also
a

never
judge
a
book
by
its
awful
cover
this
book
ranks
number
3
on
my
most
beloved
books
i
normally
take
the
book
if
it
has
an
interesting
cover
so
when
i
saw
this
horrible
one
i
immediatly
looked
for
another
the
novel
is
absolutley
superb
in
evey
single
way
exept
for
the
cover!
when
i
read
this
in
my
fourth
year
of
high
school
i
was
getting
laughed
at
for
reading
a
seemingly
girl
book
this
is
one
of
the
problems
with
the
cover!
it
will
turn
down
male
readers
in
which
the
text
is
applied
to
and
make
them
not
want
to
read
itthis
book
was
also
fun
to
parade
around
the
school
for
the
very
reason
that
it
made
a
lot
of
teachers
uncomftrable
esspecially
the
democrats
that
want
things
to
be
politicaly
correct
i
highly
reccomend
this
novel
to
anyone
who
wants
to
see
the
mind
of
a
pedophile
in
vivid
detail

both
a
cause
and
symptom
of
social
decline
this
is
the
most
comprehensively
vile
novel
since
the
days
of
de
sade

and
to
be
fair
de
sade
was
at
least
up
front
about
his
own
proclivities
defenders
of
lolita
tend
to
fall
into
two
categories
moral
apologists
and
lovers
of
art
for
art's
sake
those
in
first
category
offer
a
host
of
rationalizations

''she
seduced
him!'
'but
humbert
loved
her!'
'humbert
himself
was
a
victim''

which
seem
eerily
familiar
because
they
are
exactly
those
offered
by
pedophiles
in
mitigation
of
their
crimes
these
arguments
are
not
literary
judgments
but
rather
signs
of
moral
rot
since
lolita
is
basically
indefensible
on
a
moral
level
many
disingenuous
readers
confine
themselves
to
extravagant
praise
of
its
style
even
if
style
could
compensate
for
pathology
nabokov's
does
not
a
little
of
his
excessively
ornate
prose
goes
a
long
way
and
after
a
hundred
pages
a
sense
of
suffocation
sets
it
despicable
on
every
level

lolita
a
classic
and
one
that
i
had
placed
in
my
list
for
a
long
while
now
and
just
never
dared
to
buy
as
nabokov
explains
through
his
fictional
introduction
this
book
is
not
pornographic
and
so
if
that
is
what
you
are
expecting
you
better
put
the
book
down
and
go
read
something
else
this
is
in
fact&iquesta
love
story
not
to
say
it
is
not
a
messed
up
love
story
because
it
is
about
a
fully
adult
male
and
a
twelve
year
old
girl
which&iquestregardless
of
how
you
look
at
it
is
all
sorts
of
wrong
<br
/>
<br
/>the
interesting
thing
here
is
that
if
you
replace
pedophilia
with
just
about
any
other
romance
it
becomes
one
hell
of
a
romantic
concept
what
nabokov
has
done
is
gone
for
the
jugular
and
touched
on
the
most
unacceptable
of
taboos
and
in
turn
given
it
one
of
the
most
beautifully
worded
romance
stories
but&iquesti
do
underscore
the
romance
which
initially
was
beginning
to
wear
on
me
while
this
looked
to
be
a
happy
story
i
actually
considered
putting
the
book
down
mostly
because
i
do
not
do
romance
so
well
this
too
nabokov
seems
to
have
planned
nicely
because
just
as
i
though
this
book
may
be
too
much
of
a
love
story
for
me
the
author
throws
in
the
wrench
into
everything
he
has
methodically
built
up
and
in
my
opinion
that
saves
the
story
where
the
happy
ending
seems
forever
ruined
and
the
mystery
begins
<br
/>
<br
/>having
now
finished
and
being
able
to
contemplate
it
from
afar
the
book
rounds
up
nicely
it
does
some
things
with
language
which
are
just
absolutely
stunning
and
while
i
could
do
with
a
little
bit
less
of
romance
and
a
bit
more
of
the
mystery
i
do
think
this
is
a
very
good
book
and
recognize
it
as

found

it&iquests

book
review
lolita
is
a
twisted

of
lust
and

humbert
humbert
becomes
obsessed
with
his
landlord&iquests
daughter
out
of

his
childhood
lover
he
then
marries
his
landlord
mrs
haze
in
order
to
stay
close
to
her
daughter
dolores
the
nymphet
as
his
obsession
spirals
out
of
control
dolores
becomes
lolita
and
his
wife
becomes
obsolete
after
finding
out
about
humbert&iquests
lust
for
her
daughter
mrs
haze
is
killed
when
she
runs
out
of
her
house
in
hysterics
and
is
struck
by
a
car
the
rest
of
the
book
proceeds
with
humbert
and
lolita&iquests
travels
across
america
the
book
is
from
humbert&iquests
perspective
and
gives
the
reader
some
insight
into
the
mind
of
a
pedophile
we
see
what
he
is
willing
to
do
and
how
far
he
is
willing
to
go
to
keep
his
lolita
all
for
himself
he
sacrifices
her
happiness
and
mental
development
by
setting
up
strict
rules
that
she
must
follow
humbert
prohibits
her
from
having
a
normal
childhood
perhaps
because
she
is
not
a
normal
child
the
reader
understands
his
lust
for
this
particular
young
girl
even
though
humbert&iquests
obsession
with
lolita
is
perverse
it
is
still
tragic
when
he
loses
her
to
another
pedophile
the
reader
actually
feels
sorry
for
humbert
the
truly
pathetic
character
that
he
is
despite
the
subject
matter
the
novel
is
not
vulgar
nor
is
it
truly
about
sex
while
lolita&iquests
seduction
of
humbert
and
humbert&iquests
seduction
of
lolita
are
noted
there
is
no
hint
of
graphic
pornography
lolita
is
a
very
interesting
book

disturbing
yet
wellwritten
i
read
this
book
because
it
was
on
a
list
of
30
books
everyone
should
read
before
their
30th
birthday
list
and
i
was
highly
disturbed
i
don't
understand
how
some
reviews
call
this
book
a
love
story
there's
nothing
loving
about
some
old
pervert
taking
sexual
advantage
of
a
child
this
book
made
me
quite
angry
and
sad
for
all
children
who
have
been
sexually
abused
or
is
currently
being
sexually
abused
and
raped
by
someone
they
trusted
on
another
note
the
book
has
also
expanded
my
vocabulary
since
the
author
used
a
lot
of
words
i
had
never
seen
before
and
he
really
had
me
going
to
my
dictionary
quite
often
however
i
really
wouldn't
recommend
this
book
at
all
unless
you're
looking
to
expand
your
vocabulary

a
reviewer
lolita
is
a
magnificent
book
written
excellently
by
a
superb
author
it
is
not
about
sex
as
i
believe
someone
named
lionel
trilling
has
noted
it
is
not
pornographic
nor
sadistic
the
book
is
about
a
man
who
loved
cherished
and
lived
for
his
adopted
stepdaughter
all
other
nymphets
of
humbert
humbert's
are
just
mirages
images
glass
that
you
cannot
touch
in
the
store
without
fear
of
breaking
it
but
lolita
was
his
one
true
love
and
he
punished
all
that
would
not
see
it
that
way
even
his
fantasy
that
he
would
have
the
same
relations
with
lolita's
daughter
and
her
granddaughter
can
be
explained
he
thought
he
had
to
reincarnate
her
in
another
form
due
to
his
pedophiliac
craving
granted
humbert
was
responsible
for
the
death
of
lolita's
mother
and
he
did
not
love
her
he
was
not
even
a
true
pedophilefor
he
had
sex
with
both
his
wives
and
that
was
not
just
for
show
but
he
did
love
his
darling
lolita
and
i
commend
vladimir
nabokov
for
this
outstanding
book

i
don't

not
easy
it
was
a
good
book
but
at
the
beggining
i
could
barely
understand
what
he
was
trying
to
say
and
had
to
check
up
some
words
in
the
dictionary
it
was
not
a
pleasure
reading
that
book
it
felt
more
like
working
to
enjoy
it
i
also
had
no
feeling
to
the
ending
not
what
i
was
expecting
if
you
are
like
me
who
would
like
an
enjoyable
easy
to
read
book
i
do
not
recommend

a
twisted
romance
when
first
introduced
to
the
novel
of
lolita
i
skimmed
the
back
cover
to
see
what
the
text
was
actually
about
at
first
i
was
hesitant
to
read
this
novel
mostly
due
to
the
more
serious
nature
of
it
(don't
get
me
wrong
i
love
books
and
movies
that
make
me
think)
but
as
i
started
reading
the
first
chapters
i
realized
i
could
not
put
it
down
nabokov's
style
is
prevalent
throughout
the
entire
novel
and
his
imagination
created
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
books
i
have
ever
read
i
know
that
in
20
years
from
now
this
book
will
be
on
my
shelf
the
way
humbert
starts
his
affection
for
lolita
the
difficulties
he
faces
with
charlottei
don't
want
to
reveal
too
much
but
it's
definitely
worth
your
time

great
novel
it's
not
an
easy
book
to
read
nevertheless
it's
a
great
novel
i
wouldn't
recommend
it
to
just
anyone
only
to
those
who
can
appreciate
literature
in
more
than
one
way

i
also
recommend
repulsively
seductive
never
had
i
read
a
novel
that
seduced
me
so
much
into
the
story
that
i
forgot
that
it
was
about
a
pedophile
portrayed
as
a
testimony
to
the
reader
from
humbert
humbert
nabokov
gives
us
a
disturbing
yet
entrancing
tale
into
the
pedophile's
thoughts
with
a
brilliant
prose
style
and
almost
makes
the
reader
sympathize
with
him
and
agree
with
him
in
many
parts
of
the
novel
readers
should
pick
up
this
novel
and
read
one
of
the
most
brilliantly
written
love
stories

i
also
recommend
lolita
'lolita'
for
me
elevated
vladimir
nabokov's
status
to
a
20th
century
icon!
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
books
i
have
read
all
year!
the
subject
material
may
be
a
little
difficult
to
enter
into
for
some
but
persevere
because
this
narrative
is
well
worth
it
i
am
now
on
a
quest
to
read
everything
written
by
nabokov!

what
the
hell?
lolita
is
so
surprisingly
confusing
i
have
no
idea
what's
going
on
i
don't
understand
half
of
the
narrator
is
saying
i
don't
recall
anything
except
about
humbert's
lovers
and
lolita's
mother
other
than
that
everything
else
was
just

difficult
to
understand

breathtaking
it's
easy
to
see
how
this
book
was
censored
in
the
prudish
50's
still
it's
a
timeless
piece
of
literature
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
much
better
than
the
movie
as
the
reader
gets
to
heart
of
humbert's
obesession
with
young
girls
lolita
in
particular
the
modern
version
of
lolita
does
the
original
no
justice

an
avid
reader
so
i
have
to
admit
that
this
book
is
absolutely
beautiful
in
prose
and
based
on
that
alone
would
i
recommend
it
the
subject
matter
was
offensive
and
i'm
surprised
and
what
high
ratings
it's
received
so
