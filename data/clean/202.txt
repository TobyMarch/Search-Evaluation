20
years
of
biggest
of
queen’s
biggest
hits
–
in
music
(and
pictures

live
performances)
queen
absolute
greatest
mastered
by
bob
ludwig
from
the
original
flat
master
mix
tapes
queen
someone
ought
to
erect
a
monument
to
them
think
about
it
they’ve
ruled
their
game
longer
than
many
of
our
most
famous
leaders
their
words
can
be
repeated
by
many
more
than
can
recite
our
most
celebrated
writers
and
despite
more
than
three
generations
passing
since
they
first
blasted
their
way
into
our
consciences
they’re
just
as
omnipresent
today
as
they
ever
were
just
for
starters
(and
more
to
follow)


queen
are
britain’s
favourite
band
the
bpi
(britain’s
official
recording
body)
records
that
the
band’s
greatest
hits
1
album
is
the
biggest
selling
album
since
the
charts
were
started
over
50
years
ago

queen
are
the
most
successful
act
of
all
time
on
the
british
charts
research
by
the
team
behind
the
most
popular
music
annual
in
the
world
the
book
of
british
hit
singles

albums
reveals
that
queen
have
overtaken
the
beatles
as
official
uk
album
chart
champions
having
spent
more
weeks
on
chart
than
the
fab
four
globally
that
adds
up
to
more
than
300
million
records
sold

and
let’s
not
forget
queen’s
unmatched
global
dominance
as
live
artists
there’s
not
a
continent
in
the
world
queen’s
legendary
tours
haven’t
touched
down
in
in
many
cases
arriving
ahead
of
anyone
else
think
south
america
mexico
the
eastern
bloc
and
who
but
the
wisest
would
know
that
even
somewhere
down
there
in
the
desert
of
antarctica
sits
a
permanent
plaque
bearing
queen’s
name?

always
ready
to
try
something
new
queen
broke
rock
convention
and
created
a
stage
musical
we
will
rock
you
and
some
eight
years
on
it
still
sells
out
nightly
in
london
and
just
recently
their
alltime
worldwide
audience
crossed
over
the
10
million
mark
beyond
that
queen
continue
to
sell
out
concerts
are
ready
to
lend
their
celebrity
power
unreservedly
when
they
see
just
causes
–
such
as
nelson
mandela’s
46664
campaign
have
quietly
collected
and
distributed
over
$15
million
dollars
through
their
own
charity
the
mercury
phoenix
trust
–
fighting
aids
worldwide
and
most
telling
of
all
continue
to
be
held
in
the
highest
esteem
by
the
lead
runners
in
today’s
rock
pack
who
cite
the
band’s
influence
over
them
in
their
founding
years
let’s
face
it
few
other
acts
have
so
embedded
themselves
into
our
lives
that
we
can’t
imagine
a
time
when
queen
weren’t
around
or
can
imagine
such
a
time
in
the
future
so
what
is
it
about
queen
that
makes
it
all
so?
you
have
to
look
no
further
than
the
forthcoming
absolute
greatest
hits
package
released
november
9
(november
10
usa)
in
four
different
cd
and
lp
compact
and
luxury
sets
illustrated
with
some
fine
photos
and
videos
to
see
where
it
all
comes
from
charting
over
21
years
of
making
people
rock
feel
sense
and
celebrate
absolute
greatest
reminds
us
just
what
fine
and
smart
rock
and
pop
writers
and
musicians
messrs
deacon
may
mercury
and
taylor
were
(are)
also
that
they
had
a
sense
of
humour
which
is
perhaps
another
thing
that
made
them
so
accessible
the
earliest
hit
presented
here
seven
seas
of
rhye
(1974)
reminds
us
of
those
days
when
we
wondered
about
why
they
had
chosen
the
name
queen
whether
they
really
were
just
an
arrogant
bunch
pushing
their
luck
in
zandra
rhodes
frocks
and
black
nail
varnish
or
whether
they
really
were
the
future
of
progressive
rock
?
to
make
us
further
wonder
they
didn’t
stop
there
–
they
went
on
to
defiantly
title
their
next
single
killer
queen
then
they
flashed
the
wit
and
made
us
all
smile
and
feel
good
at
the
same
time
with
those
jaunty
ditties
like
crazy
little
thing
called
love
radio
ga
ga
and
i
want
to
break
free
and
hell
who
would
have
thought
that
roger
taylor
would
look
so
fetching
in
that
prebritney
schoolgirl
outfit
?
and
if
you
wanted
a
mass
celebration
who
better
than
queen
who
could
bond
tens
of
thousands
of
total
strangers
and
get
them
chanting
or
armwaving
in
unison
to
may’s
terse
we
will
rock
you
or
mercury’s
more
emotionally
charged
we
are
the
champions
they
could
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
be
romantic
as
deacon
proved
with
you’re
my
best
friend
or
friends
to
heartbreak
as
we
saw
in
mercury’s
somebody
to
love
or
may’s
who
wants
to
live
forever
queen
provided
a
mood
and
backdrop
for
every
time
and
every
occasion
and
were
often
at
their
best
when
they
went
for
almost
breathtaking
high
drama
aided
by
david
bowie
they
gave
us
the
brooding
heart
pounding
rhythms
of
under
pressure
the
operatically
ballistic
bohemian
rhapsody
and
perhaps
the
ultimate
curtaincall
rock
song
the
show
must
go
on
a
joyous
celebration
of
queen’s
–
and
many
of
our
own
–
greatest
moments
absolute
greatest
also
comes
in
very
personalized

in
which
band
members
brian
may
and
roger
taylor

their
own
memories

for
this
collection
in

certain

ok
–
so
it
should
not
be
expected
we
will
see
the
likenesses
of
queen
carved
into
mount
rushmore
or
find
their
way
to
a
