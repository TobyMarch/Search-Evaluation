the

an

seems
to
confirm
a
new

design
trend
—
filling

gathering
of

from
what
i
can
tell
the
new
trend
started
with
the
final

poster
which
was
created
by
blt
communications
—
a
marketing
department
disney
regularly
employs
the
design
was
pretty
great
and
almost
everyone
who
wrote
about
it
online
loved
it
so
its
no
surprise
that
the
design
was
copied
by
a
few
international
marketing
agencies
over
the
past
year
the
design
concept
was
reused
by
blt
for
the
muppets
campaign
and
this
week
warner

this
is
incredibly
mean
and
i
love
it
one
of
the
most
emotional
scenes
in

is
when
the
toys
accept
their

in

and
it
looks
like
they’re
going

die
then
at
the
very

the
aliens
save
them

the

continues
however
the

you
see
it
you

actually
think
&nbsp

–
the

may

youtube
user
justin

decided
to
take
that

he

how
is
it
that
a
movie
studio
that
produces
kid’s
films
can
be
responsible
for
so
many
of
the
best
films
in
cinema?
twenty
years
ago
that
question
would
be
directed
at
disney
now
it’s
more
likely
to
refer
to
pixar
studio
ghibli
or
even
dreamworks
of
late
what
is
it
about
children’s
entertainment
that
has
time
and
time
again
managed
to
capture
the
hearts
and
minds
of
adults
as
much
as
it
has
their
offspring?
perhaps
it’s
a
result
of
these
films
rekindling
our
lost
sense
of
childlike
wonder
and
naively
adventurous
spirit
perhaps
it’s
their
universally
accessible
narrative
simplicity
always
ready
to
charm
away
our
worries
with
the
aweinspiring
visual
splendor
through
which
these
tales
are
so
often
told
whatever
the
case
may
be
with
thirteen
films
under
their
belt
the
pixar
formula
is
one
that’s
proven
itself
to
leave
a
lasting
impression
transporting
us
to
spectacular
gorgeously
rendered
and
thoughtfully
defined
worlds
—
second
only
to
the
passionately
heartfelt
and
funny
stories
of
family
and
friendship
embedded
within
what’s
more
pixar
is
able
to
achieve
this
mixture
while
emboldening
children
to
think
for
themselves
to
challenge
the
status
quo
to
recognize
their
true
potential
as
well
as
their
limitations
as
fun
and
charming
and
pretty
as
pixar’s
films
are
it’s
the
complex
ideas
and
emotions
they
explore
that
makes
them
truly
special
affording
youths
the
opportunity
to
confront
the
realities
of
the
world
around
them
in
a
way
they
can
understand
and
cope
with
while
everyone
else
is
content
to
pander
to
kids
pixar
knows
that
the
best
way
to
communicate
with
children
is
to
treat
them
as
equals
but
equality
is
not
a
trait
shared
by
the
current
roster
of
pixar
films
despite
the
technical
virtuosity
on
full
display
with
every
production
it
takes
a
lot
more
than
stunning
animation
to
make
a
film
great
and
that’s
not
a
balance
that
pixar
always
strikes
—
at
least
not
recently
at
one
point
it
may
have
seemed
like
the
studio
could
do
no
wrong
but
that
was
a
shortlived
romantic
notion
and
hardly
one
that
merits
much
deliberation
no
far
more
instructive
would
be
to
scrutinize
their
missteps
in
conjunction
with
their
successes
and
try
to
determine
what
exactly
it
is
that
makes
any
one
of
their
works
richer
than
the
other
after
all
what
better
way
to
understand
what
makes
a
story
great
than
to
study
the
best?

the
15
reasons

doesn’t
feel

this
weekend
saw
the
release
of
pixar’s
latest
film
brave
a
movie
that
easily
won
the
weekend
garnering
an
overall
“a”
cinemascore
from
appreciative
audiences
still
at
only
74
percent
on
rottentomatoes
(pixar’s
second
worst)
and
a
7
out
of
10
from
germain
lussier
it
is
clear
there
is
a
bit
of
room
for
dissent
out
there
in
audienceland
did
you
notice
something
a
little
“off”
about
brave?
perhaps
there
are
lessons
that
can
be
learned
or
conversations
to
engage
in?
to
provide
some
context
and
on
the
off
chance
we
have
completely
different
taste
here
are
my
top
five
pixar
efforts

monsters
inc
until
now
the
only
pixar
film
i
flat
out
didn’t
enjoy
was
ratatouille
though
i
admit
to
only
having
seen
it
once
and
folks
say
i’d
like
it
much
more
if
i
were
to
revisit
even
cars
2
had
redeeming
qualities
i
can
truly
say
i’ve
never
found
a
pixar
film
entirely
lacking
and
that
statement
includes
brave
there’s
no
question
the
film
had
amazing
visuals
setting
a
new
standard
for
excellence
within
the
animation
genre
unfortunately
the
story
lacked
a
bit
of
…
what’s
the
word
i’m
looking
for?
ooomph
as
such
i’m
compelled
to
break
down
where
i
feel
the
problems
were
if
only
to
restore
everyone’s
favorite
animation
house
to
the
glory
they
so
richly
deserve
one
final
note
just
to
head
off
the
obligatory
“comparing
brave
to
the
rest
of
pixar’s
work
isn’t
entirely
fair”
argument
we’re
in
complete
agreement
there
it’s
not
fair
and
in
many
ways
pixar’s
own
ambition
and
commitment
to
excellence
have
raised
the
bar
for
all
movies
so
no
brave
isn’t
a
bad
movie
on
merit
it’s
merely
an
average
one
which
animation
houses
make
all
the
time
without
compelling
anyone
to
write
a
3000
word
article
on
the
subject
but
within
the
greater
context
of
pixar’s
previous
work
brave
does
come
up
short
and

think
we’ve
got
a
bead
