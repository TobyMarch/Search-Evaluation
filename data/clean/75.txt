bruce
wayne's
doctor
visit
in
which
the
doctor
lists
off
all
the
degenerative
injuries
to
his
body
(lack
of
cartilage
scar
tissue
etc)
and
the
use
of
a
mechanical
knee
brace
both
are
reminiscent
of
kingdom
come
where
an
older
bruce
wayne
requires
the
use
of
an
exoskeleton
to
move
due
to
years
of
physical
wear
and
tear
on
his
body

factual
errors
when
the
bad
guys
are
taking
over
gotham
there
are
a
number
of
bridges
blown
up
some
are
suspension
bridges
that
eventually
have
a
small
section
of
the
center
of
the
span
blown
away
a
simple
understanding
of
engineering
would
prove
that
stability
is
absolutely
dependent
upon
the
tension
of
the
suspending
ropes
that
stretch
over
the
tops
of
the
supporting
towers
yet
these
bridges
still
seem
to
dangle
out
far
beyond
the
towers
with
nothing
to
hold
them
up
with
the
cables
cut
everything
beyond
the
tower
should
have
fallen
