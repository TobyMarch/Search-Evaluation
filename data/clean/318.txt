code
dan
brown
masterfully
concocts
an
intelligent
and
lucid
thriller
that
marries
the
gusto

with
a
collection
of
fascinating
esoterica
culled
from
2000
years
of
western
history

silent
afterhours
halls

been
protected
by
a
clandestine
society
since
the
days
of
christ
the

is
a
highranking
agent

the
deadly
competition
the
mystery

and
langdon
on
a
breathless
flight

provides
an
amazing
interpretation

western
history
brown's
hero
and
heroine
embark
on
a
lofty
and
intriguing
exploration
of
some
of
western
culture's
greatest
mysteriesfrom
the
nature
of
the
mona
lisa's
smile
to
the

of
the
holy

though
some
will
quibble
with
the
veracity
of
brown's
conjectures
therein
lies

loved
this

flagrantly
delighted
in

7

mr

formatpaperback
well
i
read
this
book
expecting
if
not
great
things
at
least
an
exciting
and
interesting
read
sadly
i
was
disappointed
on
both
expectations
the
book
may
indeed
be
well
researched
but
unfortunately
i
found
the
characters
thin
and
lacking
in
presence
and
this
unfortunately
led
me
to
think
well
very
interesting
but
who
cares?
it
is
near
impossible
to
identify
with
characters
and
thus
become
immersed
in
the
story
if
you
feel
the
need
to
read
grail
hunting
type
books
there
are
many
others
some
better
and
some
undoubtedly
worse
the
main
failing
for
this
book
is
the
level
of
hype
it
undeservedly
received
it
leads
one
to
expect
lots
but
unfortunately
it
ultimately
disappoints
this
book
is
discounted
in
many
stores
and
was
indeed
given
away
as
a
freeby
by
my
book
club

i
really
don't
get
it
what's
all
the
fuss
about?
it's
not
bad
i'll
grant
you
but
it
ain't
no
'war
and
peace'
the
facts
and
plot
are
okay
but
not
all
that
unbiased
or
too
well
reasoned
and
the
characters
and
'thriller'
tint
are
your
basic
'onedaytrash'
novel
at
best
i'll
admit
it's
nice
this
has
finally
been
brought
to
light
in
a
novel
format
it's
a
great
idea
that's
been
sitting
around
waiting
to
be
made
into
a
book/film
for
years
but
it
could
have
been
done
so
much
better
it's
biggest
problem
is
it's
schizophrenia
it
can't
decide
whether
to
be
an
actionpacked
thriller
or
a
deep
meditative
exploration
on
religion
and
it's
intricacies
too
blabby
and
bogged
down
with
info
to
be
a
'cracking'
thriller
and
not
enough
info
or
facts
to
be
considered
a
'meaty'
and
informative
read
that
said
i
did
read
it
cover
to
cover
and
it
was
a
pleasant
enough
way
to
while
away
the
time
if
only
as
has
been
said
as
a
flight
or
train
companion
it's
worth
a
read
and
a
good
starting
block
for
the
theories
disscussed
not
that
my
opinion
really
matters
it's
still
in
the
bestseller
list
and
dan
brown
is
probably
crying
about
this
review
all
the
way
to
the
bank
however
if
you
want
more
information
that's
slightly
more
indepth
there
are
brilliant
websites
about
the
same
thing
which
give
some
great
views
on
the
whole
affair
but
if
you
want
a
similar
adventure
indiana
jones
and
the
last
crusade
is
far
better
and
more
exciting
in
a
similar
vein
but
that's
not
a
book
is
it
retroman?
so
it
kind
of
kills
your
argument
doesn't
it?
duh!
