sophie's

brother
whom
sophie
had
been
told

that

her
identity
to
protect
her
from

threats
to
her

secret
of
the
holy
grail
detail
of
the
last
supper
by
leonardo
da
vinci
in
the
novel
leigh
teabing
explains
to
sophie
neveu
that
the
figure
at
the
right
hand
of
jesus
in
leonardo
da
vinci's
painting
of
the
last
supper
is
not
the
apostle
john
but
actually
mary
magdalene
leigh
teabing
says
that
the
absence
of
a
chalice
in
leonardo's
painting
means
leonardo
knew
that
mary
magdalene
was
the
actual
holy
grail
and
the
bearer
of
jesus'
blood

leigh
teabing
goes
on
to
explain
that
this
idea
is
supported
by
the
shape
of
the
letter
v
that
is
formed
by
the
bodily
positions
of
jesus
and
mary
as
v
is
the
symbol
for
the
sacred
feminine
the
absence
of
the
apostle
john
in
the
painting
is
explained
by
knowing
that
john
is
also
referred
to
as
the
disciple
jesus
loved
code
for
mary
magdalene
the
book
also
notes
that
the
color
scheme
of
their
garments
are
inverted
jesus
wears
a
red
tunic
with
royal
blue
cloak
john/magdalene
wears
the
opposite
according
to
the
novel
the
secrets
of
the
holy
grail
as
kept
by
the
priory
of
sion
are
as
follows
the
holy
grail
is
not
a
physical
chalice
but
a
woman
namely
mary
magdalene
who
carried
the
bloodline
of
christ
the
old
french
expression
for
the
holy
grail
san
gr&eacuteal
actually
is
a
play
on
sang
r&eacuteal
which
literally
means
royal
blood
in
old
french
the
grail
relics
consist
of
the
documents
that
testify
to
the
bloodline
as
well
as
the
actual
bones
of
mary
magdalene
the
grail
relics
of
mary
magdalene
were
hidden
by
the
priory
of
sion
in
a
secret
crypt
perhaps
beneath
rosslyn
chapel
the
church
has
suppressed
the
truth
about
mary
magdalene
and
the
jesus
bloodline
for
2000
years
this
is
principally
because
they
fear
the
power
of
the
sacred
feminine
in
and
of
itself
and
because
this
would
challenge
the
primacy
of
saint
peter
as
an
apostle
mary
magdalene
was
of
royal
descent
(through
the
jewish
house
of
benjamin)
and
was
the
wife
of
jesus
of
the
house
of
david
that
she
was
a
prostitute
was
slander
invented
by
the
church
to
obscure
their
true
relationship
at
the
time
of
the
crucifixion
she
was
pregnant
after
the
crucifixion
she
fled
to
gaul
where
she
was
sheltered
by
the
jews
of
marseille
she
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
named
sarah
the
bloodline
of
jesus
and
mary
magdalene
became
the
merovingian
dynasty
of
france
the
existence
of
the
bloodline
was
the
secret
that
was
contained
in
the
documents
discovered
by
the
crusaders
after
they
conquered
jerusalem
in
1099
(see
kingdom
of
jerusalem)
the
priory
of
sion
and
the
knights
templar
were
organized
to
keep
the
secret
the
secrets
of
the
grail
are
connected
according
to
the
novel
to
leonardo
da
vinci's
work
as
follows
leonardo
was
a
member
of
the
priory
of
sion
and
knew
the
secret
of
the
grail
the
secret
is
in
fact
revealed
in
the
last
supper
in
which
no
actual
chalice
is
present
at
the
table
the
figure
seated
next
to
christ
is
not
a
man
but
a
woman
his
wife
mary
magdalene
most
reproductions
of
the
work
are
from
a
later
alteration
that
obscured
her
obvious
female
characteristics
the
androgyny
of
the
mona
lisa
reflects
the
sacred
union
of
male
and
female
implied
in
the
holy
union
of
jesus
and
mary
magdalene
such
parity
between
the
cosmic
forces
of
masculine
and
feminine
has
long
been
a
deep
threat
to
the
established
power
of
the
church
the
name
mona
lisa
is
actually
an
anagram
for
amon
l'isa
referring
to
the
father
and
mother

of

historical

main

inaccuracies
in
the
da
vinci
code
the
book
generated
criticism
when
it
was
first
published
for
inaccurate
description
of
core
aspects
of
christianity
the
history
of
the
catholic
church
and
descriptions
of
european
art
history
and
architecture
the
book
has
received
mostly
negative
reviews
from
catholic
and
other
christian
communities
many
critics
took
issue
with
the
level
of
research
brown
did
when
writing
the
story
new
york
times
writer
laura
miller
characterized
the
novel
as
based
on
a
notorious
hoax
rank
nonsense
and
bogus
saying
the
book
is
heavily
based
on
the
fabrications
of
pierre
plantard
who
is
asserted
to
have
created
the
priory
of
sion
in
1956
critics
accuse
brown
of
distorting
and
fabricating
history
for
example
marcia
ford
wrote
regardless
of
whether
you
agree
with
brown's
conclusions
it's
clear
that
his
history
is
largely
fanciful
which
means
he
and
his
publisher
have
violated
a
longheld
if
unspoken
agreement
with
the
reader
fiction
that
purports
to
present
historical
facts
should
be
researched
as
carefully
as
a
nonfiction
book
would
be[4]
richard
abanes
wrote
the
most
flagrant
aspect&nbsp
is
not
that
dan
brown
disagrees
with
christianity
but
that
he
utterly
warps
it
in
order
to
disagree
with
it

to
the
point
of
completely
rewriting
a
vast
number
of
historical
events
and
making
the
matter
worse
has
been
brown's
willingness
to
pass
off
his
distortions
as
‘facts'
with
which
innumerable
scholars
and
historians
agree[4]
the
book
opens
with
the
claim
by
dan
brown
that
the
priory
of
sion
–
a
european
secret
society
founded
in
1099
–
is
a
real
organization
this
assertion
is
broadly
disputed
some
critics
claim
that
the
priory
of
sion
was
a
hoax
created
in
1956
by
pierre
plantard
the
author
also
claims
that
all
descriptions
of
artwork
architecture
documents

and
secret
rituals
in
this
novel
are
accurate
but
this
claim
is
disputed
by
numerous
academic
scholars
expert
in
numerous
areas[5]
dan
brown
himself
addresses
the
idea
of
some
of
the
more
controversial
aspects
being
fact
on
his
web
site
stating
that
the
fact
page
at
the
beginning
of
the
novel
mentions
only
documents
rituals
organization
artwork
and
architecture
but
not
any
of
the
ancient
theories
discussed
by
fictional
characters
stating
that
interpreting
those
ideas
is
left
to
the
reader
brown
also
says
it
is
my
belief
that
some
of
the
theories
discussed
by
these
characters
may
have
merit
and
the
secret
behind
the
da
vinci
code
was
too
well
documented
and
significant
for
me
to
dismiss[6]
in
2003
while
promoting
the
novel
brown
was
asked
in
interviews
what
parts
of
the
history
in
his
novel
actually
happened
he
replied
absolutely
all
of
it
in
a
2003
interview
with
cnn's
martin
savidge
he
was
again
asked
how
much
of
the
historical
background
was
true
he
replied
99%
is
true&nbsp
the
background
is
all
true
asked
by
elizabeth
vargas
in
an
abc
news
special

rebuttal
of
the
main
arguments
of
dan
brown
and
those
of
michael
baigent
richard

and
henry

who
authored
the
book
holy

holy

in
the
programme
the
real
da
vinci
code
shown
on
british
tv
channel
4
the
program
featured
lengthy
interviews
with
many
of
the
main
protagonists
cited
by
brown
as
absolute
fact
in
the
da
vinci
code
arnaud
de
s&egravede
son
of
g&eacuterard
de
s&egravede
stated
categorically
that
his
father
and
plantard
had
made
up
the
existence
of
the
prieur&eacute
de
sion
the
cornerstone
of
the
jesus
bloodline
theory
–
to
quote
arnaud
de
sede
in
the
program
frankly
it
was
piffle
however
the
presentation
of
a
fourth
century
papyrus
fragment
called
the
gospel
of
jesus'
wife
at
the
international
congress
of
coptic
studies
in
rome
on
september
18
2012
by
karen
l
king
may
fuel
the
idea
that
early
christians
believed
that
jesus
was
married
the
papyrus
is
a
copy
of
a
gospel
dating
back
from
the
2nd
century
in
which
jesus
refers
to
my
wife[8][9]
the
earliest
appearance
of
this
theory
is
due
to
the
13thcentury
cistercian
monk
and
chronicler
peter
of
vaux
de
cernay
who
claimed
it
was
part
of
catharist
belief
that
the
earthly
jesus
christ
had
a
relationship
with
mary
magdalene
described
as
his
concubine[10]
the
program
the
real
da
vinci
code
also
cast
doubt
on
the
rosslyn
chapel
association
with
the
grail
and
on
other
related
stories
such
as
the
alleged
landing
of
mary
magdalene
in
france
according
to
the
da
vinci
code
the
roman
emperor
constantine
i
suppressed
gnosticism
because
it
portrayed
jesus
as
purely
human
the
novel's
argument
is
as
follows[11]
constantine
wanted
christianity
to
act
as
a
unifying
religion
for
the
roman
empire
he
thought
christianity
would
appeal
to
pagans
only
if
it
featured
a
demigod
similar
to
pagan
heroes
according
to
the
gnostic
gospels
jesus
was
merely
a
human
prophet
not
a
demigod
therefore
to
change
jesus'
image
constantine
destroyed
the
gnostic
gospels
and
promoted
the
gospels
of
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
which
portray
jesus
as
divine
or
semidivine
according
to
tim
o'neill
gnosticism
did
not
portray
jesus
as
merely
human[12]
all
gnostic
writings
depict
christ
as
purely
divine
his
human
body
being
a
mere
illusion
(see
docetism)[13]
some
gnostic
sects
saw
christ
this
way
because
they
regarded
matter
as
evil
and
therefore
believed
that
a
divine
spirit
would
never
have
taken
on
a
material
body[12]
literary
criticism
the
book
received
both
positive
and
negative
reviews
from
critics
and
it
has
been
the
subject
of
negative
appraisals
concerning
its
portrayal
of
history
its
writing
and
historical
accuracy
were
reviewed
negatively
by
the
new
yorker[14]
and
saloncom[15]
janet
maslin
of
the
new
york
times
said
it
concisely
conveys
the
kind
of
extreme
enthusiasm
with
which
this
riddlefilled
codebreaking
exhilaratingly
brainy
thriller
can
be
recommended
that
word
is
wow
the
author
is
dan
brown
(a
name
you
will
want
to
remember)
in
this
gleefully
erudite
suspense
novel
mr
brown
takes
the
format
he
has
been
developing
through
three
earlier
novels
and
finetunes
it
to
blockbuster
perfection[16]
david
lazarus
of
the
san
francisco
chronicle
said
this
story
has
so
many
twists
–
all
satisfying
most
unexpected
–
that
it
would
be
a
sin
to
reveal
too
much
of
the
plot
in
advance
let's
just
say
that
if
this
novel
doesn't
get
your
pulse
racing
you
need
to
check
your
meds[17]
while
interviewing
umberto
eco
in
a
2008
issue
of
the
paris
review
lila
azam
zanganeh
characterized
the
da
vinci
code
as
a
bizarre
little
offshoot
of
eco's
novel
foucault’s
pendulum
in
response
eco
remarked
dan
brown
is
a
character
from
foucault’s
pendulum!
i
invented
him
he
shares
my
characters’
fascinations—the
world
conspiracy
of
rosicrucians
masons
and
jesuits
the
role
of
the
knights
templar
the
hermetic
secret
the
principle
that
everything
is
connected
i
suspect
dan
brown
might
not
even
exist[18]
the
book
appeared
on
a
2010
list
of
101
best
books
ever
written
which
was
derived
from
a
survey
of
more

australian

salman

said
during

lecture
do
not
start
me
on
'the
da

code'
a
novel
so
bad
that
it
gives
bad
novels
a
bad
name[20]
stephen
fry
has
referred
to
brown's
writings
as
complete
loose
stoolwater
and
arse
gravy
of
the
worst
kind[21]
in
a
live
chat
on

14
2006
he
clarified
i
just
loathe
all
those
book[s]
about
the
holy
grail
and
masons
and
catholic
conspiracies
and
all
that
bottydribble
i
mean
there's
so
much
more
that's
interesting
and
exciting
in
art
and
in
history
it
plays
to
the
worst
and
laziest
in
humanity
the
desire
to
think
the
worst
of
the
past
and
the
desire
to
feel
superior
to
it
in
some
fatuous
way[22]
stephen
king
likened
dan
brown's
work
to
jokes
for
the
john
calling
such
literature
the
intellectual
equivalent
of
kraft
macaroni
and
cheese[23]
the
new

times
while
reviewing
the
movie
based
on
the
book
called
the
book
dan
brown's
bestselling
primer
on
how
not
to
write
an
english
sentence[24]
the
new
yorker
reviewer
anthony
lane
refers
to
it
as
unmitigated
junk
and
decries
the
crumbling
coarseness
of
the
style[14]
linguist
geoffrey
pullum
and
others
posted
several
entries
critical
of
dan
brown's
writing
at
language
log
calling
brown
one
of
the
worst
prose
stylists
in
the
history
of
literature
and
saying
brown's
writing
is
not
just
bad
it
is
staggeringly
clumsily
thoughtlessly
almost
ingeniously
bad[25]
roger
ebert
described
it
as
a
potboiler
written
with
little
grace
and
style
although
he
did
say
it
did
supply
an
intriguing
plot[26]
in
his
review
of
the
film
national
treasure
whose
plot
also
involves
ancient
conspiracies
and
treasure
hunts
he
wrote
i
should
read
a
potboiler
like
the
da
vinci
code
every
once
in
a
while
just
to
remind
myself
that
life
is
too
short
to
read
books
like
the
da
vinci
code[27]
lawsuits
author
lewis
perdue
alleged
that
brown
plagiarized
from
two
of
his
novels
the
da
vinci
legacy
originally
published
in
1983
and
daughter
of
god
originally
published
in
2000
he
sought
to
block
distribution
of
the
book
and
film
however
judge
george
daniels
of
the
us
district
court
in
new
york
ruled
against
perdue
in
2005
saying
that
a
reasonable
average
lay
observer
would
not
conclude
that
the
da
vinci
code
is
substantially
similar
to
daughter
of
god
and
that
any
slightly
similar
elements
are
on
the
level
of
generalized
or
otherwise
unprotectable
ideas[28]
perdue
appealed
the
2nd
us
circuit
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
original
decision
saying
mr
perdue's
arguments
were
without
merit[29]
in
early
2006
baigent
and
leigh
filed
suit
against
brown's
publishers
random
house
they
alleged
that
significant
portions
of
the
da
vinci
code
were
plagiarized
from
holy
blood
holy
grail
violating
their
copyright[30]
brown
confirmed
during
the
court
case
that
he
named
the
principle
grail
expert
of
his
story
leigh
teabing
an
anagram
of
baigent
leigh
after
the
two
plaintiffs
in
reply
to
the
suggestion
that
lincoln
was
also
referenced
as
he
has
medical
problems
resulting
in
a
severe
limp
like
the
character
of
leigh
teabing
brown
stated
he
was
unaware
of
lincoln's
illness
and
the
correspondence
was
a
coincidence[31]
because
baigent
and
leigh
had
presented
their
conclusions
as
historical
research
not
as
fiction
justice
peter
smith
who
presided
over
the
trial
deemed
that
a
novelist
must
be
free
to
use
these
ideas
in
a
fictional
context
and
ruled
against
baigent
and
leigh
smith
also
hid
his
own
secret
code
in
his
written
judgement
in
the
form
of
seemingly
random
italicized
letters
in
the
71page
document
which
apparently
spell
out
a
message
smith
indicated
he
would
confirm
the
code
if
someone
broke
it[32]
baigent

mikhail
anikin
a
russian
scientist
and
art
historian
working
as
a
senior
researcher
at
the
hermitage
museum
in
st
petersburg
stated
the
intention
to
bring
a
lawsuit
against
dan
brown
maintaining
that
he
was
the
one
who
coined
the
phrase
used
as
the
book's
title
and
one
of
the
ideas
regarding
the
mona
lisa
used
in
its
plot
anikin
interprets
the
mona
lisa
to
be
an
christian
allegory
consisting
of
two
images
one
of
jesus
christ
that
comprises
the
image's
right
half
one
of
the
virgin
mary
that
forms
its
left
half
according
to
anikin
he
expressed
this
idea
to
a
group
of
experts
from
the
museum
of
houston
during
a
1988
ren&eacute
magritte
exhibit
at
the
hermitage
and
when
one
of
the
americans
requested
permission
to
pass
it
along
to
a
friend
anikin
granted
the
request
on
the
condition
that
he
be
referenced
in
any
book
using
his
interpretation
anikin
eventually
compiled
his
research
into
leonardo
da
vinci
or
theology
on
canvas
a
book
published
in
2000
but
the
da
vinci
code
published
three
years
later
makes
no
mention
of
anikin
and
instead
asserts
that
the
idea
in
question
is
a
wellknown
opinion
of
a
number
of
scientists[33][34]
