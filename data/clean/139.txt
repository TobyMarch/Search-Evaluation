biography
liverpool
england
(1960
–
1970)
the
beatles
were
an
iconic
rock
group
from
liverpool
england
they
are
frequently
cited
as
the
most
commercially
successful
and
critically
acclaimed
band
in
modern
history
with
innovative
music
a
cultural
impact
that
helped
define
the
1960s
and
an
enormous
influence
on
music
that
is
still
felt
today
currently
the
beatles
are
one
of
the
two
musical
acts
to
sell
more
than
1
billion
records
with
only
elvis
presley
having
been
able
to
achieve
the
same
feat
after
conquering
europe
with
successful
tours
to
germany
and
sweden
the
beatles
led
the
mid1960s
musical
‘british
invasion’
into
the
united
states
although
their
initial
musical
style
was
rooted
in
1950s
rock
and
roll
and
homegrown
skiffle
the
group
explored
a
great
variety
of
musical
styles
including
psychedelic
rock
experimental
ballads
western
and
indian
classical
among
others
their
clothes
hairstyles
and
statements
made
them
trendsetters
while
their
growing
social
awareness
saw
their
influence
extend
into
the
social
and
cultural
revolutions
of
the
1960s
early
on
the
band
consisted
of
george
harrison
john
lennon
paul
mccartney
stuart
sutcliffe
and
pete
best
the
band
got
its
first
major
break
playing
in
hamburg
germany
at
some
rather
seedy
nightclubs
beginning
in
1960
while
in
germany
they
also
met
klaus
voormann
who
would
later
design
the
cover
of
the
group’s
1966
album
revolver
stuart
remained
in
germany
after
the
others
decided
to
return
to
england
and
became
engaged
to
fellow
artist
astrid
kirchherr
only
to
die
a
few
years
later
of
a
brain
hemorrhage

westhamcole
you
say
that
but
unfortunately
there
are
two
types
of
trolls
in
the
world
the
first
are
those
who
can
shed
a
satirical
humorous
new
viewpoint
on
a
band
that
makes
you
both
think
and
lol
whilst
triggering
a
reaction
by
hitting
a
bit
too
close
to
a
home
truth
for
more
hardcore
fans
there
also
ones
who
write
a
load
of
turgid
tedious
tripe
that
no
one
is
remotely
interested
in
unfortunately
jellypuppy
and
alas
myself
are
the
latter
of
the
two
and
on
that
note
the
monkees
