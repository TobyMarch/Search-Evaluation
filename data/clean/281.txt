prince
written
and
illustrated
by
antoine
de
saint
exup�ry
translated
from
the
french
by
katherine
woods
to
leon
werth
i
ask
the
indulgence
of
the
children
who
may
read
this
book
for
dedicating
it
to
a
grownup
i
have
a
serious
reason
he
is
the
best
friend
i
have
in
the
world
i
have
another
reason
this
grownup
understands
everything
even
books
about
children
i
have
a
third
reason
he
lives
in
france
where
he
is
hungry
and
cold
he
needs
cheering
up
if
all
these
reasons
are
not
enough
i
will
dedicate
the
book
to
the
child
from
whom
this
grownup
grew
all
grownups
were
once
childrenalthough
few
of
them
remember
it
and
so
i
correct
my
dedication
to
leon
werth
when
he
was
a
little
boy
