a
book
review
by
reverse
spins
believe
all
the
hype
it
is
no
accident
that
the
da
vinci
code
is
the
best
selling
novel
of
all
time
this
is
a
brilliantly
conceived
book
as
well
written
as
any
thriller
out
there
only
better
why?
because
it's
not
a
mystery
about
spies
corrupt
corporations
or
hitech
weapons
it's
about
divine
mysteries
that
have
been
kept
from
us
by
the
permutations
of
time
and
by
corrupt
individuals
in
high
spiritual
places
these
are
core
issues
of
spirituality
and
gnosis
that
resonate
with
our
pysche
and
subconscious
views
built
up
over
lifetimes
it
is
this
that
makes
the
book
so
compelling
fortunately
the
fact
that
the
author
is
an
very
good
at
his
craft
adds
to
the
enjoyment
the
action
starts
in
the
louvre
with
the
murder
of
a
man
who
is
desperate
to
pass
on
secret
information
but
has
to
do
it
through
codes
and
ciphers
so
the
information
does
not
fall
into
the
wrong
hands
the
pyramid
outside
the
louvre
he
leaves
clues
utilizing
the
works
of
leonardo
da
vinci
inside
the
louvre
why
da
vinci?
because
he
was
privy
to
many
of
the
secrets
that
have
been
an
anathema
to
the
vatican
protestants
and
the
inquisition
for
the
last
two
thousand
years
da
vinci
cleverly
painted
clues
to
some
of
the
true
mysteries
of
christ
into
many
of
his
paintings
they
are
artfully
utilized
in
this
book
all
three
of
da
vinci's
paintings
pictured
here
are
instrumental
in
unfolding
the
mystery
madonna
of
the
rocks
by
da
vinci
the
last
supper
by
leonardo
da
vinci
da
vinci
broke
with
the
traditional
view
of
the
last
supper
the
clues
explained
in
the
book
are
not
readily
apparent
although
well
known
to
those
versed
in
templar
and
priori
of
sion
legend
here
sits
jesus
in
the
middle
with
his
twelve
disciples
on
both
sides
right?
not
necessarily
one
of
the
traditional
twelve
is
not
pictured
here
in
his
place
is
painted
someone
who
is
considered
in
gnostic
tradition
his
best
disciple
i
won't
go
further
it
is
a
thriller
and
mystery
after
all
the
story
reaches
it's
climax
at
rosslyn
chapel
below
and
finally
back
in
paris
where
one
final
clue
is
waiting
at
the
louvre
rosslyn
chapel
in
scotland
this
is
a
book
that
begged
to
be
written
i
wish
i
had
written
it
if
i
had
i
would
have
added
two
not
so
insignificant
details
the
fact
that
many
important
concepts
have
been
changed
or
left
out
of
the
bible
and
church
doctrine
by
various
councils
(eg
the
nicean)
is
well
delineated
however
one
crucial
understanding
is
left
out
that
of
reincarnation
(for
more
on
reincarnation
go
to
this
link
on
this
site
karma
and
reincarnation)
it
is
an
important
element
in
the
age
old
strife
of
hiding
and
destroying
the
esoteric
teachings
of
all
major
religions
there
are
fallen
angels
and
watchers
reincarnating
among
us
jesus
came
to
judge
and
expose
them
he
used
the
book
of
enoch
which
is
vitally
concerned
with
fallen
angels
as
his
guide
they
are
the
ones
who
sew
dissension
among
religions
and
always
corrupt
the
original
teachings
the
other
thing
i
would
change
is
the
author's
mistaken
conclusion
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
holy
grail
he
can
be
forgiven
for
it
is
a
common
mistake
among
this
type
of
research
i
won't
ruin
the
story
for
you
by
revealing
his
contention
his
conclusion
is
partially
correct
but
ultimately
the
true
meaning
is
so
mystical
so
elegant
in
it's
simplicity
that
is
overlooked
because
it
is
buried
beyond
the
ken
of
mortal
eyes
the
mystical
chalice
is
not
just
buried
deep
within
some
well
nor
moved
around
from
place
to
place
it
is
centered
in
the
heart
that
can
only
be
reached
by
ardent
striving
pursuing
the
path
of
christ
and
the
buddha
no
one
can
give
us
the
chalice
although
those
who
have
become
it
are
a
tremendous
aid
on
the
trek
upward
the
mysteries
of
god
have
been
kept
from
us
but
there
are
ciphers
enough
left
in
the
world
to
help
us
find
the
key
this
book
is
one
of
those
keys
for
the
uninitiated
