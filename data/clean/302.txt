sure
he
helps
the
kids
but
all
that
makes
him
is
a
plot
facilitator
he
also
has
his
big
jesus
moment
but
that
has
the
same
problem
as
the
original
if
he
already
knows
that
there
will
be
no
lasting
negative
outcome
how
much
of
a
sacrifice
is
it
really?
but
then
aslan
isn't
based
on
the
original
figcursing
churchrejecting
rebel
jesus
but
the
whitewashed
version
like
mickey
mouse
jesus
started
out
as
an
oddball
troublemaker
with
his
fair
share
of
personality
but
becoming
the
smiling
face
of
a
multinational
organization
bent
on
world
domination
takes
a
lot
out
of
a
mascot
whether
your
magic
castle
is
in
california
or
rome
such
a
visible
figure
must
become
universally
appealing
universally
friendly
and
loving
lest
some
subset
of
followers
feel
left
out
and
it's
this
'buddy
christ'
tradition
from
which
aslan
seems
to
spring
devoid
of
insight
wisdom
or
charm
aslan
seems
mostly
to
be
present
to
do
things
that
our
protagonists
can't
do
this
also
beggars
the
question
why
didn't
aslan
just
take
care
of
all
this
stuff
long
before
the
kids
arrived?
why
did
all
the
animals
and
fairies
and
giants
have
to
suffer
the
pain
and
difficulty
of
an
endless
winter?
except
for
a
vague
mention
of
prophecy
there
isn't
any
reason
for
aslan
to
wait
for
the
kids
since
in
the
end
he
does
it
all
on
his
own
anyways
the
only
thing
they
do
end
up
helping
with
is
the
running
of
the
battle
but
this
is
only
necessary
because
aslan
is
absent
and
he's
only
absent
because
the
kids
screwed
up
indicating
that
the
entire
thing
would
have
gone
much
more
smoothly
if
they
had
never
been
there
in
the
first
place
in
that
regard
i
have
to
say
lewis
did
an
excellent
job
boiling
down
christianity
into
a
fable
and
leaving
the
problem
of
evil
completely
intact
people
have
suggested
that
he
lets
the
queen
take
over
to
teach
the
kids
a
lesson
but
is
it
really
worthwhile
to
let
all
the
inhabitants
of
a
kingdom
suffer
for
a
century
just
to
teach
a
few
kids
about
the
true
meaning
of
friendship?
the
villain
is
just
as
poorlyconstructed
and
seems
less
concerned
with
defeating
her
enemies
than
with
being
pointlessly
capricious
she
manages
to
trick
one
of
the
children
but
instead
of
taking
advantage
of
this
fact
she
immediately
makes
it
clear
that
she
tricked
him
selectively
stupid
characters
are
silly
and
convenient
especially
as
villains
because
this
completely
undermines
their
role
as
foil
it
is
impressive
when
characters
overcome
challenges
but
not
when
challenges
simply
crumble
before
them
the
children
are
lucky
the
queen
was
more
of
a
fartstealing
old
nick
than
a
miltonian
satan
otherwise
they
never
would
have
stood
a
chance
it
is
interesting
to
look
at
how
many
christian
authors
have
tried
to
reconcile
their
faith
with
complex
fairy
mythologies
not
that
christianity
doesn't
have
its
own
magical
fairy
tales
but
these
other
traditions
are
not
exactly
compatible
dante
has
virgil
lead
him
through
hell
the
buddha
was
made
into
a
saint
holidays
were
given
new
meanings
(even
if
they
often
kept
old
symbols
and
names)
and
magical
monsters
were
also
given
a
place
in
the
new
faith
in
the
middle
ages
monks
compiled
'bestiaries'
which
described
the
roles
of
dragons
unicorns
and
real
animals
in
christian
synbolism
there
were
even
centuryspanning
debates
about
whether
dogheaded
men
were
descended
from
adam
these
books
were
rarely
accurate
but
allowed
christian
theology
to
adopt
many
stories
and
superstitions
from
earlier
periods
for
instance
the
connection
between
unicorns
and
virginity
or
the
belief
that
pelicans
fed
their
own
blood
to
their
young
in
imitation
of
communion
so
lewis'
attempt
to
take
myth
and
adapt
it
to
a
christian
cosmology
is
hardly
newthere
is
a
long
and
storied
tradition
explored
throughout
the
chivalric
period
and
recognizable
today
in
books
like
the
once
and
future
king
but
lewis
doesn't
a
very
good
job
of
reconciling
these
disparate
mythologies
like
most
protestants
lewis'
religion
was
a
modern
one
not
magical
and
mystical
but
reasonable
and
utilitarian
he
did
not
draw
on
the
elaborate
convoluted
apocrypha
of
hallucinatory
monsters
and
miracles
that
mystics
obsess
over
instead
he
made
a
small
sane
reasonable
magical
worldwhich
rather
defeats
the
point
it
is
unfortunate
that
many
of
today's
readers
think
of
lewis'
writings
as
defining
english
fairy
tales
since
his
late
additions
to
the
genre
are
not
original
nor
are
they
particularly
wellexecuted
examples
many
authors
have
come
to
the
genre
with
much
more
imagination
a
deeper
sense
of
wonder
and
a
more
farreaching
exploration
of
magic
we
have
examples
from
kipling
lewis
carroll
dunsany
eddison
morris
and
even
modern
updates
by
gaiman
and
clarke
lewis
like
tolkien
may
be
a
wellknown
example
but
both
are
rather
shortsighted
and
neither
one
achieves
as
much
as
the
many
talented
authors
who
came
before
i'm
not
saying
lewis
is
bad
merely
that
he
is
unremarkable
and
is
hardly
preeminent
in
fantasy
or
even
in
children's
fantasy
but
i
do
think
his
fundamental
message
is
a
bad
one
even
if
he
didn't
realize
he
was
creating
it
in
all
of
his
worlds
he
takes
the
sorts
of
people
he
dislikes
defines
them
as
'evil'
then
sets
himself
apart
from
them
there
is
no
attempt
to
comprehend
or
to
come
to
mutual
understanding
i
cannot
respect
a
book
which
encourages
people
to
vilify
what
they
don't
understand
and
to
call
isolation
righteous
if
any
worldview
deserves
the
epithet
of
'evil'
it
is
a
willful
prideful
ignorance

from
the

we
first
see
her
in
the
novel
i
think
my
liking
for
her
carried
over
from
the
movie
–
yes
i
saw
the
movie
first
and
i
never
read
this
as
a
kid
–
but
for
the
most
part
she
was
still
pretty
awesome
in
the
book
well
sort
of
lewis
kind
of
brags
about
aslan
a
bit
or

a
lot
all
the
time
so
the
white
witch
gets
made
fun
of
i
know
some
of
you
might
say
well
it's
a
kids
book
and
for
children
at
the
time
they
were
really
careful
on
what
went
into
the
books
and
how
frightening
or
sad
it
was
lewis
doesn't
shut
up
about
it
either
he
mentions
it
a
few
times
like
oh
i
would
show
you
this
or
i
would
tell
you
this
but
if
i
did
believe
me
you
wouldn’t
be
allowed
to
read
this
book
so
i
understand
that
he
might've
felt
the
need
to
portray
aslan
as
very
strong
and
mighty
even
when
he
was
shown
as
weak
and
to
give
the
impression
that
everything
is
going
to
be
okay
–
for
the
children
you
know?
but
for
me
and
i'm
not
a
kid
it's

not
so
fun
and
gets
boring
because
all
the
suspense
is
gone
maybe
that's
why
i
really
liked
the
witch
she
brought
with
her
a
kind
of

evilness
and
power
and
she's
a
woman
and
she's
ruling
i
don't
care
if
she's
not
supposed
to
she's
pretty
awesome
and
she's
feared
in
the
movie
she
seemed
really
really
proud
to
me
and
i
liked
that
i
kind
of
imagined
her
like
that
in
the
book
too
but
then
lewis
gives
us
this
haaaarrh!
roared
aslan
half
rising
from
his
throne
and
his
great
mouth
opened
wider
and
wider
and
the
roar
grew
louder
and
louder
and
the
witch
after
staring
for
a
moment
with
her
lips
wide
apart
picked
up
her
skirts
and
fairly
ran
for
her
life
no
please
she
may
not
have
her
wand
but
i
don't
think
she
would
'pick
up
her
skirts
and
[run]
for
her
life'
–
that's
just
not
like
her
yeah
yeah
it's
lewis's
character
and
what
do
i
know
but
seriously
people
authors
always
screw
up
their
characters
without
noticing
i
believe
this
is
just
to
show
us
that
the
mighty
aslan
is
feared
by
all
and
if
that
the
witch
is
scared
of
him
yay
everything
will
be
okay
i
also
don't
like
the
idea
that
she's
shown
as
'all
bad'
–
like
she's
entirely
evil
just
because
she's
half
jinn
and
half
giant
(yes
yes
it's
a
children's
book
and
the
evil
guy
is
just
evil
and
needs
to
die
–
but
let's
ignore
that
for
a
few
moments)
i'd
heard
all
about
how
this
book
is
full
of
christian
themes
and
ideas
but
'jinn'
are
not
christian
are
they?
i
don't
think
they
are
let
me
tell
you
about
jinn
in
islam
there
are
humans
angels
and
jinn
the
humans
were
made
of
earth/clay/mud/whatever
you
prefer
calling
it
the
angels
were
made
of
light
and
the
jinn
were
made
of
fire
out
of
the
three
creatures
only
the
angels
are
pure
and
are
created
to
obey
only
they
do
not
or
cannot
commit
any
sins
so
there
are
no
such
things
as
fallen
angels
angels
remain
angels
and
they
are
powerful
creatures
that
serve
god
both
humans
and
jinn
however
have
free
will
they
can
choose
either
good
are
bad
and
they
have
both
good
and
evil
inside
them
satan
the
devil
is
a
jinn
he
was
thrown
down
to
earth
because
he
defied
god
and
his
promise
to
him
was
that
by
the
time
the
day
of
judgement
arrives
he'll
lead
as
many
people
in
to
hell
as
he
can
in
a
thousand
and
one
nights
or
arabian
nights
–
whichever
version
you
know
of
jinns
are
portrayed
as
both
good
and
evil
the
good
ones
are
called
'faeries/fairies'
i
think
in
the
english
translation
i
don't
know
what
the
real
arabic
version
calls
them
but
if
i
ever
get
my
hands
on
it
i'll
let
you
know
anyways
the
bad
jinn
are
called
just
jinn
i
think
and
they
are
the
followers
of
iblis
–
which
is
just
the
name
of
the
devil
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
just
like
humans
the
jinn
have
both
good
and
bad
they
can
be
evil
and
they
can
be
good
so
when
the
beavers
tell
the
children
that
the
white
witch
is
all
bad
and
has
no
good
in
her
because
she's
half
jinn
and
half
giant
being
the
daughter
of
lilith
my
reaction
was
“excuse
me?”
there
is
no
lilith
in
islam
and
i'm
not
very
sure
about
giants
–
though
i
do
think
they
appear
in
a
thousand
and
one
nights
but
they
might
be
some
way
associated
to
jinn?

but
if
she's
part
jinn
then
she
has
some
good
in
her
dammit
lewis
burrowed
all
sorts
of
things
with
his
giants
and
tree
spirits
and
all
of
that
but
come
on
why
would
you
just
take
this
'jinn'
and
insert
it
into
your
story
just
because?
i
know
as
a
writer
he's
free
to
take
whatever
he
wants
but
that
just
doesn't
make
sense
at
all
if
we're
looking
at
it
from
how
islam
views
jinn
then
there's
her
name
the
white
witch
why
is
she
the
white
witch?
if
she
is
really
all
bad
why
pick
the
color
white?
isn't
that
'pureness
innocence
clean'
and
a
whole
bunch
of
other
'good'
things
in
the
west?
i
guess
you
can
say
it's
because
the
winter
or
the
ice
but
hey
there
are
other
colors
too
there's
blue
there's
gray
–
or
he
could
just
not
go
with
color
at
all!
he
could
call
her
the
ice
witch
the
winter
witch
the
snow
witch
–
i
don't
know!
we
talked
about
this
in
class
too
like
why
white?
so
i
said
well
she's
half
jinn
that
was
when
i
didn't
know
that
there
were
no
such
things
as
jinn
in
christianity
and
they
were
like
is
jinn
white?
i
don't
really
know
but
if
i
were
to
pick
a
color
for
jinn
it
would
be
white
i
even
went
home
and
asked
my
mother
and
she
answered
'white'
automatically
without
even
thinking
about
it
maybe
it's
because
in
islam
jinn
are
beings
that
live
among
our
world
but
mind
their
business
if
you
mind
your
business
maybe
think
of
them
as
spirits
or
ghosts
(hate
to
call
them
ghosts
but
just
for
now)
they're
invisible
to
you
though
so
white
just
makes
sense
maybe
it's
some
influence
of
eastern
culture
on
me
that
i'm
not
aware
of
but
yes
a
lady
jinn
white
fits
her
so
i
just
cannot
see
her
as
someone
who
is
entirely
bad
or
evil
she's
half
jinn
she's
given
the
color
white
and
to
me
this
woman
had
some
reason
for
doing
what
she's
doing
i
know
in
the
story
it's
definitely
no
what
the
fuck
are
you
talking
about
did
you
even
read
but
could
lewis
have
done
a
better
job
with
her?
uh
yeah
come
on
jinn
are
fascinating
you
know
what
i
think
i'll
write
something
about
jinn
someday
someday
i
swear
i
had
more
to
say
about
her
but
moving
on
aslan
his
character
is
okay
till
around
the
part
he
gets
sacrificed
oh
wait
no
that's
not
it
it's
when
he
gets
reborn
no
that's
not
it
either
oh
yeah
it's
when
he
starts
chasing
the
girls
and
goes
yaaaay
i'm
a
kitty
come
play
with
me
tickle
me
can
i
hug
you
yaaaaaayyy
–
oh
shit
girls
we've
got
a
war
going
on
and
we
have
some
saving
to
do
stop
fooling
around
and
get
on
my
back
we
gonna
go
rescuing
ah
hah
ha
no
seriously
does
anyone
understand
what
happened
there?
i
think
lewis
was
trying
to
make
aslan
not
seem
like
the
christ
figure
so
he
inserted
that
silly
and
completely
out
of
character
scene
in
there
i
mean
he
gets
sacrificed
for
protecting
a
boy
for
the
greater
good
don't
you
see
him
as
a
christ
figure?
it's
like
lewis
went
oh
crap
this
dude's
a
lion
everyone's
going
to
talk
about
this
now
and
people
would
hate
me
for
it
or
i
should
ask
is
it
okay
to
compare
animals
to
humans?
i
don't
really
know
much
about
christianity
so
i
guess
i
can't
talk
much
about
that
but
aslan
buddy
when
you
roared
everyone
ran
the
fuck
away
why
are
you
suddenly
acting
like
a
little
baby?
it
might've
worked
a
little
better
if
we
saw
aslan
acting
more
childlike
with
the
arrival
of
the
kids
so
suddenly
coming
back
to
life
and
playing
around
a
bit
would
have
been
there
in
his
character
wait
wait
actually
no
no
even
if
you
say
like
oh
it's
like
a
whole
rebirth
thing
and
he's
all
young
and
full
of
energy
now
–
do
you
not
realize
that
there's
a
war
going
on?
they
just
fool
around
for
like
hours
and
suddenly
it's
all
business
that
makes
no
sense
if
lewis
had
shown
him
as
a
more
happy/fun
loving
character
with
the
kids
before
it
still
would've
been
really
really
stupid
of
him
to
waste
hours
just
chasing
around
the
girls
and
if
you
say
well
when
he
played
around
he
was
right
on
time
for
everything
else
that
happened

still
no
it's
a
book
you
can
write
it
a
billion
ways
and
make
it
work

but
this
does
not
work
no
wonder
they
cut
that
out
in
the
movie
it's
completely
stupid
okay
finally
to
susan
i
think
i
mentioned
something
about
the
essay
i
had
to
write
when
i
was
reading
this
book
so
that
essay
turned
into
a
comparison
between
this
and
alice's
adventures
in
wonderland
it
was
about
culture
war
society
and
something
i
don't
know
but
i
talked
a
bit
about
why
this
or
that
was
not
included
so
i'll
skip
most
of
that
here
there's
one
important
question
left
though
why
was
susan
given
a
freaking
bow
and
arrow?
why
was
lucy
given
a
knife?
why
was
susan
who
was
older
than
edmund
not
participating
in
the
war
with
her
freaking
amazing
bow
which
never
misses?
why
would
you
give
someone
something
that
they
never
end
up
using?
why
would
you
send
the
younger
child
to
war?
why
not
send
two
of
the
older
ones
and
leave
two
of
the
younger
ones
to
get
a
little
closer?
edmund
treated
lucy
like
shit
don't
you
think
if
edmund
and
lucy
spent
time
together
during
that
aslanisgettingsacrificed
bit
they'd
get
to
know
each
other
better?
more
bonding
time!
or
is
it
because
one's
a
guy
and
the
other
a
girl
they
wouldn't
like
to
be
in
each
other's
company?
ohthat'snotonequestionsorry
what
is
the
reason
for
edmund
being
such
an
ass?
i
think
the
movie
did
a
better
job
with
this
if
i
remember
right
he
was
all
grouchy
and
mean
because
he
missed
his
daddyor
both
his
parents?
i'm
not
sure
but
because
of
the
war
that
makes
a
ton
of
sense
so
why
does
susan
have
such
an
amazing
weapon
if
she
does
not
use
it?
she
uses
it
in
the
movie
so
that
was
good
but
really
you
have
something
that
will
strike
anything
you
aim
for
and
you
don't
use
it?
it
just
makes
no
sense
why
is
that
amazing
weapon
in
this
book?
oh
but
this
is
only
one
book
what
do
i
know
about
the
rest
of
the
series?
i
asked!
and
they
told
me
she
doesn't
do
any
archery
and
she
doesn't
kick
any
ass
and
you
know
that's
okay
it
would
be
fine
if
susan
and
lucy
were
both
shown
as
the
characters
who
were
more

caretakers
supporters
helpers
instead
of
fighters
but
why
giver
her
the
freaking
bow?
what's
that
there
for?
lucy
is
given
a
dagger
and
told
to
use
it
only
when
she
really
needs
to
a
little
kid
given
a
dagger
in
a
time
of
war
told
it's
dangerous
and
only
to
use
when
she
has
to
all
right
i
understand
she
doesn't
use
it
and
i
understand
she
didn't
need
to
instead
that
potion
healing
thing
was
more
important
but
susan
she's
given
a
horn
to
blow
when
she
needs
help
and
she's
given
an
amazing
freaking
weapon
she
uses
the
horn
but
not
that
amazing
weapon
i
feel
sorry
for
that
weapon
i
really
do
it's
like
if
i
buy
chocolate
and
i
never
eat
it
what
a
waste
think
about
it
a
little
though
if
susan
had
practiced
a
bit
she
might've
even
saved
aslan
from
getting
sacrificed
maybe
she
could've
hid
in
the
shadows
and
fired
an
arrow
at
the
white
witch
or
something
oh
but
there
was
no
need
you
say?
aslan
was
fine?
so?
are
you
just
going
to
ignore
the
fact
that
one
of
the
characters
has
an
amazing
weapon
just
so
it
doesn't
mess
with
your
plot?
and
think
about
how
awesome
she
would've
been
if
she
did
take
part
in
the
war!
just
standing
on
some
hill
firing
arrows
right
and
left
hitting
everything
and
everyone
imagine
it
for
a
second(less)
like

critisize
cs
lewis
for
using
too
much
christian
symbolism
but
i
was
in
4th
grade
and
to
me
this
was
the
most
wonderful
and
exciting
book
ever
written
for
children
when
mr
goodwin
finished
the
book
i
instantly
went
to
the
library
so
i
could
read
it
myself
i
was
very
proud
this
was
the
first
book
i
read
without
pictures
to
my
joy
i
discovered
there
were
other
books
about
narnia
and
i
eventually
read
all
of
them
too
evenutually
i
discovered
other
wonderful
places
in
other
books
and
i
continue
to
look
for
them
today
i
will
always
be
grateful
to
mr
goodwin
he
started
off
by
telling
me
about
narnia
but
in
the
end
he
introduced
me
to
so
much
more
through
my
on
going
love
of
books
thank
you
mr
goodwin
for
everything

the

he
passed

growing
lamppost
would
stick
with
me
from
that
moment
as
i
learned
to
read
the
narnia
books
were
the
first
novels
i
sunk
my
literary
teeth
into
and
to
this
day
i
have
read
and
re
read
the
novels
back
to
front
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
is
a
novel
written
for
both
children
and
adults
it
contains
highly
allegorical
elements
as
cslewis
was
a
wellknown
apologetics
writer
however
he
wrote
that
he
did
not
write
his
novel
as
a
pure
allegory
but
as
a
story
and
that
is
what
the
lion
the
witch
and
the
wardrobe
is
a
story
to
be
enjoyed
by
everyone
and
although
written
in
simple
language
the
reader
can
quickly
concisely
and
easily
imagine
the
world
without
the
clumsy
constraints
of
overused
words
i
personally
cannot
imagine
a
world
without
these
novels
additional
thoughts
1
just
a
question
at
last
and
one
with
a
highly
philosophical
twist
to
it
why
is
it
that
people
so
readily
condemn
those
books
which
are
considered
as
moral
tales?
you'd
think
we
could
do
with
more
morality
in
such
a
twisted
and
confused
world
regardless
of
accepting
the
belief
systems
2
i
have
heard
many
people
describe
the
entire
series
as
silly
and
far
too
preachy
i
do
not
see
it
that
way
at
all
trust
me
if
cslewis
wanted
to
be
preachy
he
would
have
written
a
lot
more
philosophy
and
less
story
yes
i
can
see
how
some
would
call
this
silly
but
then
i
argue
that
they
are
missing
the
point
it's
a
fairytale
type
fantasy
intended
mainly
for
children
(and
for
those
children
again
as
adults
or
for
their
parents
perhaps)
but
i
argue
that
as
lewis
only
wrote
this
story
based
on
the
story
of
the
crucifixion
in
many
ways
that
it
was
not
intended
as
a
preachy
book
my
question
is
that
why
is
it
that
if
i
were
to
base
a
story
along
what
some
call
the
'christian
myth'
it
is
claimed
as
preaching
while
as
if
i
were
to
base
it
on
any
other
mythology
or
story
it
would
be
deemed
as
merely
copying
the
themes
of
another
mythology?
is
this
yet
another
example
of
doublethink?*

an
answer
which
i
only
came

years

after
i'd
read
schweitzer
and
bultmann
it
basically
amounted
to
their
agreeing
that
yes
christianity
was
absurd
and
that
the
core
of
it
was
christ
crucified
not
the
resurrection
that's
absurd
christ
crucified
at
least
that's
the
way
i
constructively
interpreted
these
nice
people
four
years
later
when
i
actually
had
come
to
know
quite
a
lot
about
their
religion
they
also
loaned
me
a
copy
of
lewis'
children's
book
the
lion
etc
first
volume
of
his
narnia
series
presumably
because
i'd
mentioned
having
read
and
liked
his
perelandra
trilogy
and
autobiography
dutifully
i
gave
it
a
tryand
hated
it
now
as
an
adult
of
sorts
having
also
read
and
despised
his
screwtape
letters
i
could
see
through
the
story
to
the
underlying
propaganda
and
it
bothered
me
a
lot
that
children
were
intended
to
be
exposed
to
it
still
they
were
nice
people
i
suffered
through
the
thing
out
of
respect
for
them
now
reflecting
on
my
own
early
exposure
to
and
appreciation
of
cs
lewis
i
am
less
prone
to
be
upset
i
survived
the
insidious
brainwashing

appears
my
fourteen
year
old
niece
has
managed

okay
let
me
say
first
of

that

that
being
said
this

made
me
feel

message
but
unfortunately
it's
impossible
to
read
the
story
without
getting
a
headache
from
the
constant
hammering
that
is
the
message
this
story
is
a
fun
idea
fantasywise
i
particularly
love
the
ice
queen
and
the
turkish
delight
scemore
okay
let
me
say
first
of
all
that
i
think
cs
lewis
is
a
brilliant
man
that
being
said
this
book
made
me
feel
like
he
could
have
given
a
little
credit
to
the
rest
of
us
i
wish
i
could
review
it
based
solely
on
the
story
and
not
bother
with
the
religious
message
but
unfortunately
it's
impossible
to
read
the
story
without
getting
a
headache
from
the
constant
hammering
that
is
the
message
this
story
is
a
fun
idea
fantasywise
i
particularly
love
the
ice
queen
and
the
turkish
delight
scene
with
edmund
however
(and
there
is
a
big
'however')
i
just
couldn't
get
past
the
whole
lecturedinchurch
feeling
that
this
book
produced
don't
get
me
wrong
i
am
a
religious
person
and
i
believe
in
christ
with
all
my
heart
but
i
personally
get
a
lot
more
out
of
reading
scriptures
about
him
than
this
allegorical
fantasy
so
if
lewis
had
allowed
it
to
be
a
layered
thing
ya
know
enjoy
the
story
and
if
you
see
the
parellels
to
christ
and
his
mission
good
for
you
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
a
lot
more
as
it
was
i
felt
like
every
other
paragraph
was
practically
screaming
at
me
get
it??
you
get
it??
the
lion
came
back
to
life!!
yeah
we
got
it
i
read
prince
caspian
because
i
was
curious
about
the
rest
of
the
story
but
i'm
done
it
was
a
little
too
much
for
me
and
i'll
just
stick
to
my
scriptures
rather
than
talking
lions(less)

the

is
not

and
the
characters
are
frustratingly
transparent
vehicles
for
lewis's
real
objective
which
is
the
retelling
of
the
passion
of
the
christ
plus
there's
an
excessive
and
annoying
degree
of
anthropomorphizing
(ok
so
the
animals
must
be
able
to
talk
in
order
for
the
story
to
go
forward
but
must
the
beavers
wear
snowboots
and
aslan
the
lion
stand
on
two
feet?)
the
central
question
for
me
however
is
how
useful
such
an
imaginative
allegory
can
possibly
be
i
guess
cs
lewis
can
thumb
his
nose
at
me
for
this
question
though
since
people
are
still
reading
the
chronicles
of

and
still
making
movies
not
only
about
aslan

also
human
versions

exert

especially
the
kinds
of
stories
that
draw
on
the
deep
mythical
archetypes
of
fantasy
to
illuminate
the
real
universe
the
chronicles
of
narnia
his
classic
fantasy
series
was
the
fruit
of
that
discovery
set
in
narnia
a
magical
land
whose
world
lies
in
another
universe
in
which
magic
works
and
time
moves
differently
than
it
does
here
and
in
which
christ
is
incarnate
as
the
great
talking
lion
aslan
this
first
book
of
the
series
presents
one
of
the
most
powerful
symbolic
literary
presentations
of
the
christian
gospel
ever
written
although
the
intended
audience
in
lewis'
mind
was
children
(and
his
author's
various
direct
addresses
to
the
readers
presuppose
this)
there
is
nothing
invidiously
juvenile
about
the
quality
of
the
writing
it
can
be
enthusiastically
appreciated
by
anyone
who
loves
tales
of
imagination
and
adventure
fantasy
and
wonder
and
the
truths
here
like
those
in
jesus'
parables
are
simple
enough
to
speak
to
children
but
profound
enough
to
challenge
adults
this
is
the
first
book
of
the
series
in
the
sense
of
first
to
be
written
(and
usually
the
first
to
be
read)
however
the
magicians
nephew
is
a
prequel
which
describes
the
creation
of
narnia
and
the
origins
of
the
white
witch
and
of
the
wardrobe
that
serves
as
a
gateway

and
had

on
reading
the
book
i
realized
it's
just
an
extention
of
the
movie(should
have
been
the
other
way
round
but
then
the
one
which
comes
first
usually
forms
the
greater
impression)
i'm
glad
the
scripwriters
did
not
destroy
the
essence
of
the
story
which
is
(though
simple)
a
charming
tale!
anyway
coming
back
to
the
story
it
is
about
four
adventurous
children
who
accidentally
discover
the
magical
world
of
narnia
behind
a
wardrobe
in
an
old
strange
house
but
all
in
not
well
in
this
magical
land!
it's
under
the
reign
of
the
evil
queen

the
white
witch!
together
with
the
help
of
a
magnificant
lion

aslan
the
children
go
on
to
kill
the
witch
and
themselves
become
the
four
kings(and
queens!)
of
narnia
though
lacking
much
plot
twists
i
loved
it
simply
because
it
was
so
easyflowing!
i
altually
wished
i
had
a
naughty
kid
near
me
whom
i
could
catch
hold
of
and
read
the
book
aloud
to!
i
would
love
to
see
his
wideeyed
amazement
when
lucy
would
open
the
wardrobe
for
the
first
time
see
his
dissapointment
when
edmund
would
betray
them
(view
spoiler)[hear
his
sigh
when
aslan
would
sacrifice
his
life
(hide
spoiler)]
and
catch
that
gleeful
smile
when
they
would
win
the
battle!
maybe
someday
sometime!
ps
i
really
liked
the
dedication
it
read

my
dear
lucy
i
wrote
this
story
for
you
but
when
i
began
it
i
had
not
realized
that
girls
grow
quicker
than
books
as
a
result
you
are
already
too
old
for
fairy
tales
and
by
the
time
it
is
printed
and
bound
you
will
be
older
still
but
some
day
you
will
be
old
enough
to
start
reading
fairy
tales
again
you
can
then
take
it
down
from
some
upper
shelf
dust
it
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
i
shall
probably
be
too
deaf
to
hear
and
too
old
to
understand
a
word
you
say
but
i
shall
still
be
your
affectionate
godfather
cslewis
dear
god
i
hope
i'm
never
too
old
for
fairy
tales!

absolutely

the

essay
about

go
ahead
and
look
it
up
on
wikipedia
if
you're
interested
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
this
is
the
first
one
it
is
the
one
in
which
we
along
with
the
children
are
introduced
to
narnia
and
every
one
published
after
it
follows
the
story
in
a
way
a
reader
can
relate
with
ans
appreciate
just
so
everyone
knows
i
an
reviewing
the
1970
collier
book
edition
of
lww)
i
just
got
done
rereading
this
one

it's
the
first
time
i've
picked
it
up
in
many
years
it's
a
breeze
to
get
through
which
is
sad
because
i
remember
being
very
proud
of
myself
for
getting
through
it
in
the
fourth
grade
but
oh
well
i'd
rather
not
do
a
total
movietobook
comparison
but
and
don't
crucify
me
(haha)
the
movie
deals
with
this
story
better
it
is
more
exciting
the
characters
evolve
everyone's
reaction
is
more
believable

and
yet
the
original
story
is
entirely
intact
i
love
the
story
don't
get
me
wrong
but
reading
the
written
work
again
after
watching
to
movie
it
just
seems
like
bare
bones
i'd
forgotten
how
sparse
the
writing
is
another
thing
i
had
forgotten
is
just
how
metafictive
(new
word
i
think)
the
whole
thing
is
lewis
spends
an
awful
lot
of
time
referencing
the
fact
that
he
is
writing
this
book
which
is
slightly
offputting
for
modern
readers
that
would
be
forgiven
really
if
he
didn't
use
it
to
not
describe
so
many
things
i
suppose
if
you
are
a
very
young
child
and
he
claims
that
something
is
so
frightening
he
dares
not
describe
it
to
you
it
forces
that
child
to
use
her
imagination
in
order
to
fill
in
the
blanks
yet
the
successful
descriptions
of
similar
things
in
say
a
series
as
popular
as
the
harry
potter
books
makes
one
wonder
if
it
wasn't
just
a
cop
out
or
cultural
handicap
yet
there
are
rare
places
where
this
tecnique
seems
to
work
in
his
favor
such
as
places
where
he
is
describing
a
visual
sort
of
magic
he
will
write
i
suppose
you
have
seen
something
and
then
elaborate
that
this
is
how
it
looked
somewhat
this
will
give
most
kids
a
really
clear
picture
of
what
is
happening
making
this
story
easily
read
aloud
to
children
as
young
as
(i
would
say)
five
there
are
also
very
interesting
parts
where
i
find
myself
connecting
to
what's
going
on
on
a
very
different
level
and
it
is
because
lewis
addressed
the
reader
that
one
allows
oneself
to
feel
this
way
the
best
example
is
the
aftermath
of
the
great
battle
when
everyone
is
heading
to
cair
paravel
to
see
the
children
crowned
here
the
sea
is
described
with
such
excitement
it
does
seem
as
if
you
are
coming
to
the
palace
yourself
the
castle
of
cair
paravel
on
its
little
hill
towered
up
above
them
before
them
were
the
sands
with
rocks
and
little
pools
of
salt
water
and
sea
weed
and
the
smell
of
the
sea
and
long
miles
of
bluishgreen
waves
breaking
forever
and
ever
on
the
beach
and
oh
the
cry
of
the
seagulls!
have
you
heard
it?
can
you
remember?
this
one
line
innocently
placed
can
you
remember?
there
is
not
one
moment
in
your
mind
what
i
should
be
remembering
or
from
what
because
i
was
there
can
you
remember
because
lewis
is
desperately
trying
to
get
the
message
across
that
we
were
all
there
and
we
have
all
heard
it
and
it
will
only
take
a
quick
jog
of
the
memory
to
remember
now
i
am
not
christian

in
fact
i
am
a
wiccan
and
have
always
been
distainful
of
christians
who
do
whatever
they
can
to
convert
me
lay
off
already
but
that
does
not
mean
that
i
don't
know
a
good
story
when
i
read
one
whether
or
not
lewis
is
talking
about
jesus
(and
yeah
i
know
he
is)
that
feeling
was
a
very
good
one
there
are
some
things
you
just
have
to
let
go
you
know?
it
isn't
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
to
have
your
kids
know
that
you
shouldn't
sacrifice
your
family
for
turkish
delight
er
as
it
were
just
like
it
isn't
the
worst
thing
to
have
your
kids
put
faith
in
themselves
science
and
other
human
endevours
as
phillip
pullman
is
teaching
via
the
golden
compass
etc
in
fact
the
less
you
stress
out
about
what
philosphies
your
kids
are
exposed
to
early
in
life
the
less
angsty
and
rebellious
they'll
be
later
on
but
i
digress
what
is
important
to
note
is
a
note
of
sexism
within
this
novel
(i
did
not
notice
any
racism

at
least
not
as
blatent
as
the
misogynism

but
there
have
been
cases
brought
up
to
that
affect
as
well
once
again
wiki
it)
when
father
christmas
brings
the
children
their
presents
he
tells
the
girls
to
only
use
their
weapons
if
they
truly
need
to
and
never
in
battle
when
lucy
says
she
may
be
brave
enough
santa
says
battle
is
ugly
when
women
fight
as
opposed
to
how
pretty
it
is
when
men
go
at
it?
just
an
example
later
in
the
series
it
becomes
more
apparent
that
lewis
felt
that
there
was
a
place
for
women
we
do
have
to
remember
the
time
in
which
it
was
written
and
simply
empower
our
girls
by
other
means
i
honestly
don't
think
that
this
series
will
instill
in
children's
minds
the
idea
that
boys
are
better
than
girls
in
short
read
this
because
it's
a
classic
and
a
very
good
readaloud
but
really
watch
the
movie
too
i
think
it
does
a
fantastic
job
of
sprucing
up
an
old
fairy
tale

it's

loved

wasn't

by
them
put
a

we
criticize
lewis
for

his

view
criticize
the
world
view
or
wish
that

had
hidden
his

i
can
think
of
other
authors
i've
read
who
put
forth
more
distasteful
views
but
i'll
still
read
their
works
i'm
glad
that
he
put
his
view
front
and
center
to
be
accepted
or
challenged
i
don't
have
the
fond
childhood
associations
that
some
people
have
with
this
work
but
as
an
adult
i
found
the
book
(and
the
series)
to
be
an
interesting
bit
of
writing
lewis
is
less
subtle
than
tolkien
in
his
christ
symbolism
at
least
in
this
the
first
book
written
lewis
is
troubling
because
he
is
that
most
dangerous
of
creatures
the
convert
he
shows
a
simple
version
of
christianity
that
doesn't
come
close
to
accounting
for
the
religion's
contradictions
complexity
and
failings
i
updated
this

was

enjoyed
them
purely
for
the

in
particular
i
recall
the
message
in
the
last
battle
being
that
of
tolerance
in
that
people
of
differeing
religions
would
not
automatically
be
sent
to
a
christian
hell
but
would
be
considered
for
entry
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
(narnia
beyond
the
doorway)
on
the
basis
of
their
conduct
in
life
therefore
a
bad
narnian
who
abuses
his
fellow
man
will
go
to
tash's
hell
(i
admit
the
calormenes
and
their
god
tash
did
come
across
somewhat
as
barbarian
muslims)

will

added
it
recommends
it
for
everyone
when
i
first
started
reading
this
book
i
knew
it
was
old
but
because
my
sister
told
me
there
was
a
special
meaning
or
plot
i
continued
to
read
i
choose
this
for
my
book
review
because
this
book
makes
me
smile
and
a
ten
year
old
to
a
40
year
old
could
still
read
the
pages
are
shorter
but
the
meaning
is
still
there
this
book
is
about
a
lion

is

four
children

and
peter
lucy
the
youngest
then
edward
following
elithabeth
and
peter
the
stmore
when
i
first
started
reading
this
book
i
knew
it
was
old
but
because
my
sister
told
me
there
was
a
special
meaning
or
plot
i
continued
to
read
i
choose
this
for
my
book
review
because
this
book
makes
me
smile
and
a
ten
year
old
to
a
40
year
old
could
still
read
the
pages
are
shorter
but
the
meaning
is
still
there
this
book
is
about
a
lion
who
is
a
king
named
aslan
and
four
children
names
lucy
elithabeth
edwin
and
peter
lucy
the
youngest
then
edward
following
elithabeth
and
peter
the
story
starts
out
as
the
children
are
playing
hide
and
seek
and
slipp
into
the
wardrobe
not
knowing
they
are
soon
entering
the
land
of
narnia
ruled
by
the
evil
white
whitch
what
they
didn't
know
was
edwin
would
soon
betray
them
and
help
the
white
whitch
take
over
narnia
and
make
it
winter
all
year
long
as
edwin
finally
figures
out
the
true
intentions
of
the
whitch
he
goes
back
to
his
family
who
are
fighting
a
war
with
aslan
against
the
white
whitch
after
the
war
is
fought
aslan
and
the
true
animals
win
and
the
children
become
kings
and
queens
of
narnia
many
years
after
they
find
there
way
back
to
the
wadrobe
to
find
only
minutes
have
passed
between
narnia
and
the
real
world
i
didn't
understand
the
meaning
of
this
book
intill
the
end
of
this
book
this
book
is
about
god!
and
the
white
whitch
is
the
devil
after
talking
to
my
sister
about
this
she
said
you
didn't
figure
this
out
earlier
cs
lewis
is
a
big
relgious
writer
i
find
irony
in
this
because
when
the
white
whitch
thinks
that
by
killing
aslan
she
is
going
to
win
it
actually
brings
him
back
stronger
then
ever
to
win
the
war
i
find
tolerance
in
this
book
because
aslan
is
so
calm
with
the
whitch
and
the
evil
creatures
and
never
shows
hatred
but
understanding
through
all
of
it
this
book
was
so
good
i
reccomend
this
to
anyone
who
love
a
good
adventure
and
a
good
read!

reading
this
book
it
was
a
bit
nostalgic
remembering
that
this
series
were
actually
one
of
the
earliest
serial
books
that
i
had
read
in
english
before
this
books
in
english
always
terrified
medon`t
know
why
but
foreign
language
intimidates
me
more
so
when
reading
the
thick
intelligently
wellversed
ones
but
this
book
was
quite
simple
in
language
and
it
was
stylish
in
terms
of
writing
about
the
story
i
could
actually
grasp
some
christianity
elements
being
put
affront
for
readers
blame
the
knowledge
of
knowing
that
cs
lewis
wrote
this
with
some
connections
to
that
religious
belief
father
of
christmas
the
resurrections
adam
eve
and
some
morequite
obvious
they
were
even
in
terms
of
setting
where
narnia
was
once
a
bare
land
whitish
with
cold
and
snow
until
the
four
siblings
came
and
with
the
help
of
aslan
lights
and
warmth
appeared
again
thus
the
biblical
reference
in
here
anyway
ignoring
the
connection
one
can
still
enjoy
the
book
this
one
didn`t
really
catch
me
enough
unlike
the
other
ones
but
it
was
still
good

unfortunately

up
1
(lion
witch
wardrobe)
it
came
used
with
a
young
hand
upon
it
apparently
the
reader
was
writing
a
paper
about
temperature
and
every
reference
to
“cold”
“ice”
“snow”
“freeze”
etc
has
been
underlined
(“the
tea
had
grown
cold”)
a
nasty
distraction
from
a
simple
read
what
i
appreciated
about
lww
was
exactly
the
same
thing
that
i
resented
it
was
quick
and
to
the
point
an
easy
tale
to
tell
a
child
lacking
the
detail
of
character
action
and
motive
that
could
have
turned
it
into
something
to
be
read
again
as
an
adult
&agrave
la
lord
of
the
rings
or
lloyd
alexander
it’s
a
wonderfully
constructed
story
(nice
allegory
regardless
of
your
feelings
about
christianity)
for
an
eight
yearold
and
i
wish
i’d
read
it
then
rather
than
now
i
might
have
liked
it
all
that
said
i
think
i'll
get
through
the
rest
of
the
box
if
only
to
understand
why
they've
meant
so
much
to
others
and
to
prompt
some
greater
thought
on
writing
for
children
alright
so
they
got
better
not
enough
to
merit
individual
reviews
but
good
enough
to
get
through
them
all
in
a
couple
of
sittings
and
even
lww
looks
better
in
retrospect
if
only
for
its
setting
the
stage
for
a
more
complex
universe

a
result
you
are
already
too
old
for
fairy
tales
and
by
the
time
it
is
printed
and
bound
you
will
be
older
still
but
some
day
you
will
be
old
enough
to
start
reading
fairy
tales
again
you
can
then
take
it
down
from
some
upper
shelf
dust
it
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
i
shall
probably
be
too
deaf
to
hear
and
too
old
to
understand
a

you
say

i
shall
still
be
