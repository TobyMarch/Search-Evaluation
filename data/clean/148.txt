biography
tupelo
ms
united
states
(1954
–
1977)
elvis
aaron
presley
(tupelo
mississippi
january
8
1935

memphis
tennessee
august
16
1977)
was
an
american
singer
song
producer
and
actor
a
cultural
icon
he
is
widely
known
by
the
single
name
elvis
elvis
presley
began
his
music
career
at
sun
records
in
the
spring
of
1954
when
sam
philips
recorded
elvis
performing
several
of
elvis’
favourite
songs
with
scotty
moore
(guitar)
and
bill
black
(bass)
one
of
these
covers
was
a
country
and
western
song
“blue
moon
of
kentucky”
elvis
is
the
bestselling
solo
artist
of
all
time
in
the
united
states
with
confirmed
1892
million
records
in
riaa
shipments
before
sam
philips
sold
elvis’
contract
to
rca
victor
in
1956
for
$35000
they
had
recorded
six
twosided
singles
each
of
these
recordings
featured
a
country
and
western
song
on
one
side
and
a
rhythm
and
blues
song
on
the
other
one
of
the
reasons
elvis
was
so
popular
was
because
of
his
ability
to
merge
attributes
of
what
was
perceived
to
be
“white”
(cw)
and
“black”
(rb)
music
an
example
of
this
is
evident
in
elvis’
hit
song
“heartbreak
hotel”
which
reached
#1
not
only
in
the
pop
charts
but
the
rb
and
cw
charts
as
well
this
was
the
first
time
that
a
single
song
held
the
#1
spot
in
all
three
charts
elvis
remains
a
popular
and
enigmatic
star
his
legend
has
only
grown
stronger
since
his
death
in
fact
there
is
a
widespread
belief
that
elvis—who
was
known
by
his
first
name—did
not
die
in
1977
many
fans
persist
in
claiming
he
is
still
alive
that
he
went
into
hiding
for
various
reasons
this
claim
is
allegedly
backed
up
by
thousands
of
socalled
elvis
sightings
that
have
occurred
in
the
years
since
his
death
and
by
the
fact
that
his
middle
name
aron
was
misspelled
aaron
with
two
as
on
his
tombstone
