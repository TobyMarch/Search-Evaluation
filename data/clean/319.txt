an
excellent
read
but
it's
truly
sad
to
think
that
some
readers
assume
that
dan
brown's
contrived
history
is
factual
and
would
even
base
their
spiritual
beliefs
on
a
book
of
fiction
just
read
some
of
the
other
reviews
to
see
what
i'm
talking
about
it
reminds
of
the
guy
who
watched
too
many
episodes
of
highlander
and
decided
he
was
an
immortal!
(i'm
not
making
this
up)
one
reader
compared
da
vinci
code
to
james
beauseigneur's
christ
clone
trilogy
and
suggested
that
like
beauseigneur
brown
should
footnote
all
the
factual
material
while
beauseigneur
and
brown
have
a
similar
style
and
both
deal
with
controversial
religious
topics
beauseigneur
can
footnote
the
facts
in
his
fiction
because
they
are
facts
brown's
facts
cannot
be
footnoted
because
they
are
a
fictitious
as
the
rest
of
the
book

the
book
thus
i
had
my
computer
connected
to
internet
besides
me
to
dig
out
different
paintings
and
photos
of
what
the
book
mentioned
like
louvre
pentacle
the
last
supper
opus
dei
headquarters
etc
luckily
the
da
vinci
code
special
illustrated
edition
is
just
out
i
couldn't
wait
and
purchased
immediately
regardless
i
have
the
regular
hardcover
edition
of
da
vinci
code
which
i
plan
to
give
it
to
one
of
my
friends
this
special
illustrated
edition
is
not
a
cartoon
or
comic
edition
of
dan
brown's
da
vinci
code
nor
it
is
an
abridged
version
it's
a
full
original
version
embedded
with
over
126
colorful
pictures

photos
besides
the
text
it
saves
you
lots
of
time

effort
to
search
from
internet
if
you
don't
know
how
ch&acircteau
de
villette
looks
like
the
overview
map
of
the
louvre
and
many
other
scenes
buildings
paintings
mentioned
in
dan
brown's
da
vinci
code
overall
it's
lovely!
undoubtfully
dan
brown
has
done
amazing
jobs
to
his
book
the
da
vinci
code
the
story
is
powerful
and
magnificent
mixing
with
a
lot
of
traceable
truth
and
facts
he
made
his
novel
sound
extremely
convincing
and
inevitably
deluded
you
from
what's
real
and
what's
fictional
however
please
don't
take
it
too
serious
it's
just
a
novel
not
a
research
paper
trying
to
make
a
breakthrough
statement
overall
the
book
has
quite
a
lot
of
twists
shocking
you
even
the
ending
has
double
meanings
make
sure
you
read
the
epilogue
chapter
or
you
won't
know
where
the
holy
grail
rests
that
dan
brown
suggested
as
the
poem
below
the
holy
grail
'neath
ancient
roslin
waits
the
blade
and
chalice
guarding
o'er
her
gates
adorned
in
masters'
loving
art
she
lies
she
rests
at
last
beneath
the
starry
skies
for
people
who
love
deciphering
codes
dan
brown
wisely
placed
some
codings
on
the
regular
hardcover
edition's
paper
cover
if
you
pay
attention
you
may
find
some
bold
fonts
seemed
appearing
randomly
link
them
up
and
you
should
see
a
hint
to
read

formathardcover
i
was
introduced
to
the
books
of
author
dan
brown
only
three
weeks
ago
but
have
quickly
absorbed
all
four
of
his
published
works
it
is
easy
to
see
why
some
are
comparing
the
work
of
dan
brown
and
james
beauseigneur
(the
christ
clone
trilogy)
both
brown
and
beauseigneur
deal
masterfully
with
the
more
mysterious
features
of
religion
politics
and
science
both
bring
to
light
amazing
bits
of
information
which
they
weave
into
the
intricate
patterns
of
their
stories
both
are
highly
imaginative
and
write
with
a
ring
of
authenticity
that
makes
for
a
compelling
read
while
brown
compresses
labyrinthine
plots
into
brief
time
periods
to
provide
pageturning
suspense
beauseigneur
trilogy
is
of
epic
proportion
covering
several
decades
while
brown
applies
the
mysteries
of
history
to
the
drama
of
today
beauseigneur
uses
both
history
and
prophecy
(from
perhaps
a
dozen
major
world
religions)
to
transport
the
reader
from
the
world
of
today
to
the
very
dawning
of
a
new
age
in
a
story
reminiscent
of
the
scope
of
asimov's
classic
foundation
one
other
difference
is
that
beauseigneur
has
taken
the
novel
(pun
intended
and
forgiveness
is
asked)
approach
of
including
footnotes
in
his
books
of
fiction
by
doing
so
he
all
but
eliminates
the
necessity
of
suspending
disbelief
few
authors
employ
such
strong
factual
grounding
as
to
make
footnotes
useful
but
i
believe
brown's
work
(and
his
readers)
would
benefit
from
beauseigneur's
innovation

how
could
anyone
give
this
less
than
5
stars?
i
realize
that
some
critics
have
accused
the
da
vinci
code
of
being
full
of
cliches
and
predictable
characters
but
give
me
a
break!
