the
jackal
sydney
carton
the
“idlest
and
most
unpromising
of
men”
makes
his
way
from
the
tavern
to
mr
stryver’s
apartment
the
men
drink
together
and
discuss
the
day’s
court
proceedings
stryver
nicknamed
“the
lion”
compliments
his
friend
“the
jackal”
for
the
“rare
point”
that
he
made
regarding
darnay’s
identification
however
he
laments
carton’s
moodiness
ever
since
their
days
in
school
together
stryver
observes
carton
has
fluctuated
between
highs
and
lows
“now
in
spirits
and
now
in
despondency!”
carton
shrugs
off
stryver’s
accusation
that
his
life
lacks
a
unified
direction
unable
to
match
stryver’s
vaulting
ambition
carton
claims
that
he
has
no
other
choice
but
to
live
his
life
“in
rust
and
repose”
attempting
to
change
the
subject
stryver
turns
the
conversation
to
lucie
praising
her
beauty
carton
dismisses
her
as
a
“goldenhaired
doll”
but
stryver
wonders
about
carton’s
true
feelings
for
her
summary

hundreds
of
people
four
months
later
mr
lorry
now
a
trusted
friend
of
the
manette
family
arrives
at
doctor
manette’s
home
finding
manette
and
his
daughter
not
at
home
he
converses
with
miss
pross
they
discuss
why
the
doctor
continues
to
keep
his
shoemaker’s
bench
their
conversation
also
touches
on
the
number
of
suitors
who
come
to
call
on
lucie
miss
pross
complains
that
they
come
by
the
dozen
by
the
hundred—all
“people
who
are
not
at
all
worthy
of
ladybird”
in
miss
pross’s
opinion
the
only
man
worthy
of
lucie
is
her
own
brother
solomon
pross
who
she
laments
disqualified
himself
by
making
a
certain
mistake
lorry
knows
however
that
solomon
is
a
scoundrel
who
robbed
miss
pross
of
her
possessions
and
left
her
in
poverty
he
goes
on
to
ask
if
manette
ever
returns
to
his
shoemaking
and
pross
assures
him
that
the
doctor
no
longer
thinks
about
his
dreadful
imprisonment
lucie
and
manette
return
and
soon
darnay
joins
them
darnay
relates
that
a
workman
making
alterations
to
a
cell
in
the
tower
of
london
came
upon
a
carving
in
the
wall
“d
i
g”
at
first
the
man
mistook
these
for
some
prisoner’s
initials
but
he
soon
enough
realized
that
they
spelled
the
word
dig
upon
digging
the
man
discovered
the
ashes
of
a
scrap
of
paper
on
which
the
prisoner
must
have
written
a
message
the
story
startles
manette
but
he
soon
recovers
carton
arrives
and
sits
with
the
others
near
a
window
in
the
drawing
room
the
footsteps
on
the
street
below
make
a
terrific
echo
lucie
imagines
that
the
footsteps
belong
to
people
that
will
eventually
enter
into
their
lives
carton
comments
that
if
lucie’s
speculation
is
true
then
a
great
crowd
must
be
on
its
way
analysis
chapters
5–6
dickens
devotes
chapter
5
to
the
character
of
sydney
carton
whom
he
nicknames
“the
jackal”
given
the
secondary
meaning
of
the
term—an
accomplice
in
the
commission
of
menial
or
disreputable
acts—the
name
seems
fitting
alongside
his
colleague
stryver
carton
seems
little
more
than
an
assistant
he
lacks
ambition
in
the
courtroom
he
spends
his
time
staring
at
the
ceiling
outside
of
it
he
spends
his
time
getting
drunk
carton
accepts
his
pathetic
state—he
says
to
stryver
matteroffactly
“you
have
fallen
into
your
rank
and
i
have
fallen
into
mine”
yet
for
all
of
his
supposed
indifference
he
betrays
his
desire
for
a
better
more
exalted
life
carton
alludes
several
times
to
the
respectable
life
that
he
might
have
lived
at
the
end
of
chapter
4
he
admits
to
hating
darnay
because
the
man
reminds
him
of
what
he
could
have
been
he
echoes
this
sentiment
in
chapter
5
telling
stryver
“i
thought
i
should
have
been
much
the
same
sort
of
fellow
[as
darnay]
if
i
had
had
any
luck”
these
feelings
evidence
his
resentful
awareness
of
darnay
as
his
double—a
successful
and
happy
double
and
thus
a
mocking
one
carton
views
darnay
as
a
concrete
manifestation
of
a
life
he
might
have
led
a
life
preferable
to
his
own
the
closing
of
the
chapter
alludes
to
the
secret
longings
of
a
man
who
will
not
admit
to
having
any
in
the
fair
city
of
this
vision
there
were
airy
galleries
from
which
the
loves
and
graces
looked
upon
him
gardens
in
which
the
fruits
of
life
hung
ripening
waters
of
hope
that
sparkled
in
his
sight
a
moment
and
it
was
gone
climbing
to
a
high
chamber
in
a
well
of
houses
he
threw
himself
down
in
his
clothes
on
a
neglected
bed
and
its
pillow
was
wet
with
wasted
tears
a
great
gulf
exists
between
the
life
that
carton
leads
and
the
life
that
he
imagines
for
himself
between
the
type
of
man
that
he
is
and
the
type
of
man
that
he
dreams
of
being
carton’s
complex
and
conflicted
inner
life
paves
the
way
for
his
dramatic
development
which
eventually
elevates
him
out
of
his
jackal
status
dickens
employs
masterful
foreshadowing
in
chapter
6
as
he
uses
these
scenes
both
to
hint
at
carton’s
eventual
ascendance
into
glory
and
to
anticipate
two
vital
plot
turns
the
discovery
of
the
mysterious
letter
in
the
tower
of
london
and
manette’s
distress
upon
hearing
of
it
foreshadows
the
moment
when
during
a
later
trial
the
prosecution
will
confront
the
doctor
with
a
letter
he
wrote
while
imprisoned
in
the
bastille
as
the
second
trial
forms
the
dramatic
core
of
the
latter
half
of
the
novel
the
discovery
of
this
second
letter
forms
a
crucial
part
of
the
plot
and
dictates
the
course
of
the
characters’
lives
by
introducing
the
story
of
a
first
and
parallel
letter
dickens
prepares
the
reader
for
the
discovery
of
the
second
as
soon
as
the
second
letter
surfaces
the
reader
will
instantly
recognize
it
as
important
the
second
event
that
dickens
foreshadows
is
the
french
revolution
itself
the
“hundreds
of
people”
to
which
the
title
of
chapter
6
owes
its
name
refers
not
to
lucie’s
suitors
(whose
numbers
miss
pross
clearly
exaggerates)
but
to
the
multitude
of
angry
mutinous
revolutionaries
who
as
lucie
and
carton
foretell
will
soon
march
into
the
characters’
lives
