an
audiobook
production
of
watership
down
in
the
sandleford
warren
fiver
a
young
runt
rabbit
who
is
a
seer
receives
a
frightening
vision
of
his
warren's
imminent
destruction
when
he
and
his
brother
hazel
fail
to
convince
their
chief
rabbit
of
the
need
to
evacuate
they
set
out
on
their
own
with
a
small
band
of
rabbits
to
search
for
a
new
home
barely
eluding
the
owsla
the
warren's
military
caste
the
traveling
group
of
rabbits
find
themselves
following
the
leadership
of
hazel
previously
an
unimportant
member
of
the
warren
they
travel
through
dangerous
territory
with
bigwig
and
silver
both
former
owsla
and
buckthorn
as
the
only
significantly
strong
rabbits
among
them
the
company
cope
with
many
dangers
but
none
so
insidious
as
their
encounter
with
cowslip's
warren
here
the
company
encounter
an
apparently
prosperous
rabbit
colony
with
pampered
and
fastidious
citizens
who
enjoy
plenty
of
food
and
protection
from
predators
by
humans
however
fiver
is
profoundly
suspicious
especially
when
he
observes
the
local
culture
disdains
the
traditional
tales
of
elahrairah
in
favor
of
maudlin
fatalistic
poetry
when
fiver
attempts
to
leave
a
derisive
bigwig
learns
firsthand
the
deadly
secret
of
the
warren
the
whole
area
is
a
human
designed
rabbit
farm
with
numerous
snares
placed
to
harvest
them
after
helping
bigwig
escape
fiver
convinces
his
fellows
to
leave
this
decadent
colony
immediately
and
afterward
his
counsel
is
followed
without
question
fiver's
visions
promise
a
safe
place
in
which
to
settle
and
the
group
eventually
finds
watership
down
an
ideal
location
to
set
up
their
new
warren
they
are
soon
reunited
with
holly
and
bluebell
also
from
the
sandleford
warren
who
reveal
that
fiver's
vision
was
true
and
the
entire
warren
was
destroyed
by
humans
nuthanger
farm
hampshire
england
in
2004
although
watership
down
is
a
peaceful
habitat
hazel
realizes
there
are
no
does
thus
making
the
future
of
their
new
home
uncertain
with
the
help
of
a
seagull
named
kehaar
they
locate
a
nearby
warren
efrafa
which
is
overcrowded
and
has
many
does
hazel
sends
a
small
emissary
composed
of
holly
silver
buckthorn
and
strawberry
to
efrafa

present
their
request
for

a
gunshot
wound
to
his
hind
leg
it
is
a
wound
that
will
never
truly
heal
and
will
play
a
large
part
in
the
rest
of
the
story
hazel

the
tidings
to
watership
down
setting

an
adventurous
and
