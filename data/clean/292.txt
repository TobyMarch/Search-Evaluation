the
guests
realize

into
coming
to
the
island
each
of

lured
with

notices

is
missing
from

mrs

dies
peacefully
in

sleep

attributes
to

comes
in
and

a
sleeping
aid
which
she
then
overdosed(one

the

is
indeed
found
dead
from
a
blow
to
the
back
of
his
skull
by
a
life
preserver
(one
said
he'd
stay
there)
finally
the
point
is
driven
home
that
these
three
deaths
have
been
murder
meanwhile
a
third
figurine
has
disappeared
from
the
dining
room
in

panic
armstrong

search
the

murderer
justice
wargrave
establishes
himself
as
the
decisive
leader
of
the
group
and
asserts
one
of
them
must
be
the
murderer
playing
a
sadistic
game
with
the
rest
the
killer's
twisted
humor
is
evidenced
by
the
names
of
their
hosts
un
owen
is
a
pun
and

homophone
for
unknown
the
next
morning
rogers
is
missing

is
found
dead
in
the
woodshed

is
killed
in

room
by
an
injection
of
potassium
cyanide
that
leaves
a
mark
on
her
neck
(a
bumblebee
stung
one)
which
at
first
appears
to
be
a
sting
from
a
bumble
bee

in
the
room
the
hypodermic
needle
is
found
outside
her
window
next
to
a
smashed
china
figurine
the
five
remaining
people
armstrong
wargrave
lombard
claythorne
and
blore
appear
to
become
increasingly
frightened
and
paranoid
as
the
noose
tightens
both
psychologically
and
in
reality
wargrave
suggests
they
lock
up
any
potential
weapons
including
armstrong's
medical
equipment
and
the
judge's
own
sleeping
pills
lombard
admits
to
bringing
a
revolver
to
the
island
but
immediately
discovers
it
has
gone
missing
resolved
to
keep
the
killer
from
catching
anyone
alone
they
gather
in
the
drawing
room
and
only
leave
one
at
a
time
vera
goes
up
to
her
room
for
a
shawl
and
is
frightened
by
a
strand
of
seaweed
hanging
on
a
hook
in
her
bedroom
in
the
dark
an
allusion
to
the
boy
the
gramophone
alleged
that
she
had
drowned
her
screams
attract
the
attention
of
blore
lombard
and
armstrong
who
rush
to
her
aid
when
they
return
to
the
drawing
room
they
find
wargrave
in
a
mockery
of
a
judicial
wig
and
gown
with
a
gunshot
wound
in
his
forehead
(one
got
into
chancery)
armstrong
confirms
the
death
and
they
lay
wargrave's
body
in
his
room
and
cover
it
with
a
sheet
shortly
afterward
lombard
discovers
his
revolver
has
been
returned
that
night
blore
hears
someone
sneaking
out
of
the
house
he
and
lombard
investigate
and
discovering
armstrong
missing
assume
the
doctor
is
the
killer
in
the
morning
blore
leaves
for
food
and
does
not
return
vera
and
lombard
soon
discover
his
body
on
the
terrace
skull
crushed
by
a
bearshaped
clock
(a
big
bear
hugged
one)
at
first
they
continue
to
believe
armstrong
is
the
killer
until
they
find
the
doctor
in
the
sea
drowned
(a
red
herring
swallowed
one)
paranoid
each
assumes
the
other
is
the
murderer
in
the
brief
but
tense
standoff
that
follows
vera
feigns
compassion
and
gets
lombard
to
help
her
move
armstrong's
body
away
from
the
water
using
the
opportunity
to
pick
his
revolver
from
his
pocket
she
kills
lombard
with
a
shot
through
the
heart
on
the
beach
(one
got
frizzled
up)
and
returns
to
the
house
dazed
and
disoriented
she
finds
a
noose
and
chair
waiting
for
her
in
her
room
in
an
apparent
trance
she
hangs
herself
kicking
the
chair
out
from
underneath
her

the
mystery
with

arranged
un

purchase
of
the
island
and
sent
out
the
invitational
letters
covered
his
tracks
quite
well
and
was
killed
the
day
the
party
set
sail
times
of
death
cannot
be
found
through
autopsies
and
the
police
have
failed
to
link
the
nursery
rhyme
to
the
deaths
while
guests'
diaries
establish
a
partial
timeline
that
establish
that
marston
mrs
rogers
macarthur
mr
rogers
brent
and
wargrave
were
the
first
6
to
die
(in
that
order)
the
police
cannot
determine
the
order
in
which
blore
armstrong
lombard
and
vera
were
killed
blore
could
not
have
dropped
the
clock
on
himself
and
it
would
also
be
a
highly
uncommon
method
of
suicide
armstrong's
body
was
dragged
above

lombard
was
shot
on
the
beach
but
his
revolver
was
found
on
the
floor
in
the
upstairs
hallway
vera's
fingerprints
on
the
gun
the
fact
that
hanging
is
a
highly
sensible
method
of
suicide
and
the
clock
that
killed
blore
having
come
from
her
room
all
point
to
vera
as
un
owen
but
someone
had
to
have
been
alive
after
she
died
because
the
chair
vera
used
to
hang
herself
had
been
righted
and
replaced
against
the
wall
inclement
weather
combined
with
the
fact
that
fred
narracott
(the
man
who
ferried
the
guests
to
the
island)
sent
a
boat
to
the
island
as
soon
as
weather
allowed
(sensing
something
to
be
amiss)
would
have
prevented
the
murderer
from
leaving
or
arriving
separately
from
the
guests
he
or
she
must
have
been
among
them
but
since
the
first
six
murders
at
least
appear
to
be
accounted
for
and
since
the
last
four
victims
cannot
have
been
the
last
ones
alive
the
inspectors
are
ultimately
left
dumbfounded
asking
themselves
who
killed
them?
postscript
a
fishing
trawler
finds
a
letter
in
a
bottle
off
the
devon
coast
it
contains
the
confession
of
the
late
justice
wargrave
he
reveals
a
lifelong
sadistic
temperament
juxtaposed
uneasily
with
a
fierce
sense
of
justice
he
wanted
to
torture
terrify
and
kill
but
could
never
justify
harming
an
innocent
person
as
a
judge
he
directed
merciless
jury
instructions/summations
and
guilty
verdicts
but
solely
in
those
cases
in
which
he
had
satisfied
himself
of
the
guilt
of
the
defendant(s)
thrilling
at
the
sight
of
the
convicted
person
crippled
with
fear
facing
their
impending
death
he
also
saved
a
few
defendants
from
suffering
punishment
when
he
was
convinced
they
were
innocent
of
their
accused
crime
but
the
proxy
of
the
bench
was
unsatisfying
wargrave
longed
to
commit
murder
by
his
own
hand
prompted
to
action
by
the
discovery
that
he
was
terminally
ill
he
sought
out
those
who
had
caused
the
deaths
of
others
but
managed
to
escape
justice
finding
nine
(not
including
isaac
morris)
whom
he
lured
to
the
island
using
his
financial
resources
to
investigate
his
victims'
backgrounds
to
come
up
with
plausible
invitations
from
sources
they
trusted
or
from
people
with
whom
they
were
acquainted
after
the
phonograph
accusations
were
made
the
first
night
he
carefully
watched
as
he
had
in
the
courtroom
for
so
many
years
the
reactions
of
his
guests
to
the
accusations
seeing
their
fear
or
anxiety
he
was
certain
of
their
guilt
he
decided
to
start
with
the
less
serious
offenders
(ie
marston
whom
wargrave
determined
was
amoral
and
had
committed
the
crime
by
accident
as
well
as
mrs
rogers
who
had
acted
under
her
husband's
direction
and
had
clearly
been
traumatized
by
guilt
ever
since)
and
to
save
the
prolonged
mental
strain
and
fear
for
the
colderblooded
killers
wargrave
arrived
at
the
island
with
two
drugs
potassium
cyanide
and
chloral
hydrate
after
the
gramophone
recital
wargrave
slipped
cyanide
and
chloral
into
the
drinks
of
marston
and
mrs
rogers
respectively
marston
choked
to
death
and
mrs
rogers
was
given
another
sleep
medication
leading
to
death
by
overdose
the
next
day
after
macarthur
made
his
fatalistic
prediction
wargrave
sneaked
up
on
him
and
killed
him
although
the
specific
weapon
was
never
found
or
discussed
the
next
morning
he
killed
rogers
in
the
woodshed
as
he
was
cutting
firewood
during
breakfast
he
slipped
the
rest
of
his
chloral
into
miss
brent's
coffee
to
sedate
her
and
after
she
was
abandoned
at
the
table
wargrave
injected
her
with
the
rest
of
his
cyanide
using
armstrong's
syringe
having
disposed
of
his
first
five
victims
the
judge
persuaded
the
trusting
armstrong
to
fake
wargrave's
own
death
the
red
herring
under
the
pretext
that
it
would
rattle
or
unnerve
the
real
murderer
since
armstrong
was
the
only
person
who
would
closely
examine
the
judge's
body
as
well
as
having
done
preliminary
autopsies
for
the
other
victims
up
to
that
point
the
ruse
went
undetected
that
night
he
met
armstrong
on
the
cliffs
distracted
him
by
pretending
to
see
something
and
pushed
him
into
the
sea
knowing
the
doctor's
disappearance
would
provoke
the
suspicions
of
the
others
from
vera's
room
wargrave
later
pushed
the
stone
bearshaped
clock
onto
blore
crushing
his
skull
after
watching
vera
shoot
lombard
he
then
set
up
a
noose
and
a
chair
in
her
bedroom
in
the
belief
that
after
having
just
killed
lombard
she
was
in
a
psychologically
posttraumatic
state
and
would
hang
herself
under
the
right
circumstances
ie
a
noose
and
chair
waiting
for
her
he
was
right
and
watched
(unseen
in
the
shadows)
as
she
hanged
herself
wargrave
then
pushed
the
chair
she
had
stood
on
against
the
wall
wrote
out
his
missive/confession
put
the
letter
in
a
bottle
and
tossed
it
out
to
sea
wargrave
admits
to
a
pitiful
human
craving
for
recognition
that
he
had
not
initially
counted
on
even
if
his
letter
is
not
found
(he
decides
there
is
about
a
1
in
100
chance
of
it
being
found)
he
believes
there
are
three
clues
which
implicate
him
although
he
surmises
(correctly)
that
the
mystery
will
not
have
been
solved
wargrave
was
the
only
one
invited
to
the
island
who
had
not
wrongfully
caused
someone's
death
initial
public
speculation
around
the
time
of
the
trial
of
edward
seton
whom
the
gramophone
accused
wargrave
of
murdering
notwithstanding
seton
was
in
fact
guilty
of
the
murder
for
which
he
had
been
convicted
and
overwhelming
proof
emerged
after
seton's
death
confirming
this
(when
questioned
about
the
seton
matter
by
his
guests
after
the
gramophone
recital
wargrave
actually
told
the
truth—albeit
not
very
convincingly
and
not
mentioning
the
posthumous
evidence
against
seton—to
wit
that
seton
was
guilty
and
he
had
instructed
the
jury
accordingly
wargrave
knew
his
fellow
guests
would
not
believe
that
and
would
despite
his
judicial
vocation
consider
him
a
fellow
escapee
from
justice)
thus
ironically
the
only
innocent
guest
must
be
the
murderer
the
red
herring
line
in
the
poem
suggests
that
armstrong
was
tricked
into
his
death
by
someone
he
trusted
of
the
remaining
guests
only
the
respectable
justice
wargrave
would
have
inspired
the
doctor's
confidence
the
red
mark
on
wargrave's
forehead
received
from
shooting
himself
is
similar
to
the
one
god
bestowed
upon
cain
as
punishment
for
killing
his
brother
abel
he
says
the
brand
of
cain
might
lead
the
investigators
to
realize
he
was
the
murderer
wargrave
describes
how
he
planned
to
kill
himself
he
will
loop
an
elastic
cord
through
the
gun
tying
one
end
of
the
cord
to
his
eyeglasses
and
looping
the
other
around
the
doorknob
of
an
open
door
he
will
then
wrap
a
handkerchief
around
the
handle
of
the
gun
and
shoot
himself
in
the
head
his
body
will
fall
back
as
though
laid
there
by
armstrong
the
gun's
recoil
will
send
it
to
the
doorknob
and
out
into
the
hallway
roughly
where
vera
dropped
it
while
she
walked
to
her
room
detaching
the
cord
and
pulling
the
door
closed
the
cord
will
dangle
innocuously
from
his
glasses
and
the
stray
handkerchief
should
not
arouse
suspicion
thus
the
police
will
find
ten
dead
bodies
and
an
unsolvable
mystery

soldier

resulted
in
the
deaths
of
other
human
beings
and
then
said
when
you
read
what
happens
after
that
you
will
not
believe
it
but
you
will
keep
on
reading
and
as
one
incredible
event
is
followed
by
another
even
more
incredible
you
will
still
keep
on
reading
the
whole
thing
is
utterly
impossible
and
utterly
fascinating
it
is
the
most
baffling
mystery
that
agatha
christie
has
ever
written
and
if
any
other
writer
has
ever
surpassed
it
for
sheer
puzzlement
the
name
escapes
our
memory
we
are
referring
of
course
to
mysteries
that
have
logical
explanations
as
this
one
has
it
is
a
tall
story
to
be
sure
but
it
could
have
happened[18]
such
was
the
quality
of
christie's
work
on
this
book
that
many
compared
it
to
her
1926
novel
the
murder
of
roger
ackroyd
for
instance
an
unnamed
reviewer
in
the
toronto
daily
star
of
16
march
1940
said
others
have
written
better
mysteries
than
agatha
christie
but
no
one
can
touch
her
for
ingenious
plot
and
surprise
ending
with
and
then
there
were
none
she
is
at
her
most
ingenious
and
most
surprising
is
indeed
considerably
above
the
standard
of
her
last
few
works
and
close
to
the
roger
ackroyd
level[19]
other
critics
laud
the
use
of
twists
turns
and
surprise
endings
maurice
richardson
wrote
a
rhapsodic
review
in
the
observer's
issue
of
5
november
1939
which
began
no
wonder
agatha
christie's
latest
has
sent
her
publishers
into
a
vatic[clarification
needed]
trance
we
will
refrain
however
from
any
invidious
comparisons
with
roger
ackroyd
and
be
content
with
saying
that
ten
little
niggers
[an
alternative
name
to
the
mystery]
is
one
of
the
very
best
most
genuinely
bewildering
christies
yet
written
we
will
also
have
to
refrain
from
reviewing
it
thoroughly
as
it
is
so
full
of
shocks
that
even
the
mildest
revelation
would
spoil
some
surprise
from
somebody
and
i
am
sure
that
you
would
rather
have
your
entertainment
kept
fresh
than
criticism
pure
after
stating
the
setup
of
the
plot
richardson
concluded
story
telling
and
characterisation
are
right
at
the
top
of
mrs
christie's
baleful
form
her
plot
may
be
highly
artificial
but
it
is
neat
brilliantly
cunning
soundly
constructed
and
free
from
any
of
those
redherring
false
trails
which
sometimes
disfigure
her
work
[1]
robert
barnard
a
recent
critic
concurred
with
the
reviews
describing
the
book
as
suspenseful
and
menacing
detectivestorycumthriller
the
closed
setting
with
the
succession
of
deaths
is
here
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion
and
the
dangers
of
ludicrousness
and
sheer
readerdisbelief
are
skillfully
avoided
probably
the
bestknown
christie
and
justifiably
among
the
most
popular[20]
the
original
name
of
the
mystery
[ten
little
niggers]
has
long
been
abandoned
as
offensive
and
on
grounds
of
political
correctness
(the
use
of
the
term
caused
damage
to
the
national
health
service
(nhs)
career
of
a
british
nursing
administrator
pat
bottrill)
some
critics
claim
christie's
original
title
and
the
setting
on
nigger
island
[later
changed
to
indian
island
for
the
reasons
stated
above]
are
integral
to
the
work
these
aspects
of
the
novel
argues
alison
light
could
be
relied
upon
automatically
to
conjure
up
a
thrilling
'otherness'
a
place
where
revelations
about
the
'dark
side'
of
the
english
would
be
appropriate[21]
unlike
novels
such
as
heart
of
darkness
christie's
location
is
both
more
domesticated
and
privatised
taking
for
granted
the
construction
of
racial
fears
woven
into
psychic
life
as
early
as
the
nursery
if
her
story
suggests
how
easy
it
is
to
play
upon
such
fears
it
is
also
a
reminder
of
how
intimately
tied
they
are
to
sources
of
pleasure
and
enjoyment[21]
adaptations
and
then
there
were
none
has
had
more
adaptations
than
any
other
single
work
of
agatha
christie
they
often
used
christie's
alternative
ending
from
her
1943
stage
play
with
the
setting
often
being
changed
to
locations
other
than
an
island
stage
in
1943
agatha
christie
adapted
the
story
for
the
stage
in
the
process
of
doing
so
she
and
the
producers
agreed
that
audiences
might
not
flock
to
such
a
grim
tale
and
it
would
not
work
well
dramatically
as
there
would
be
no
one
left
to
tell
the
tale
thus
she
reworked
the
ending
for
lombard
and
vera
to
be
innocent
of
the
crimes
of
which
they
were
accused
survive
and
fall
in
love
some
of
the
names
were
also
changed
with
general
macarthur
becoming
general
mckenzie

because
of
the
reallife

douglas

prominent
role
