place

why
is
saito

in
limbo?
if
the
top
really
does
keep
spinning
at
the
end
and
cobb's

didn't
it

tracks?
how
do
the

fall
asleep

did
cobb
and
mal
enter

was
the
decaying
city

wears

trashed?
what's
the
original
plan
of
the
inception
mission?
in
the
film
cobb
pulled
a
mr
charles
on
fischer
due
to
the
time
constraints
what
exactly
is
mr
charles?
when
ariadne
finds
mal
in
the
basement
of
cobb's
memories
she
starts
to
tell
mal
her
name
but
mal
cuts
her
off
i
know

you
are
how
does

know
who
ariadne
is?
what's
happening
in
the
extraction
mission
at
the
beginning
of
the
film?
is
eames
the
dreamer
for
the
third
level
or
fischer?
there
are
4
levels
of
dream
based
on
saito's
age
in
the
palace
it
could
be
about
50
years
has
passed
(50
years
in
dream
4
=
25
years
in
dream
3
=
15
months
in
dream
2
=
23
days

1

3
hrs
in
reality)
since
cobb
supposed
to
wake
up
earlier
and
the
stewardess
shouldn't
be
passing
immigration
forms
could
this
mean
that
the
ending
could
be
a
dream?
why
does
the
police
investigation
regarding
mal's
case
put
all
the
blame
on
cobb
and
thinks
that
he
killed
her?
what
is
the
time
frame
for
each
dream
level?
was
ariadne
somehow
aware
of
the
numbers
fischer
would
come
up
with
or
did
she
change
the
hotel's
floor
plan
so
that
491
would
be
below
528?
how
does
one
wake
up
from
limbo?
what
did
cobb
putting
a
spinning
top
inside
the
safe
mean?
what
is
the
evidence
that
show
the
whole
film
is
a
dream?
what
are
the
evidences
that
show
reality
exists
during
the
film
and
cobb
is
in
reality
at
the
end
of
the
film?
what
is
the
music
used
in
the
trailers?
does
cobb
ever
wake
up?
where
was
dream
level
3rd
(the
snow
fort)
filmed?
what
year
does
this
film
take
place?
are
the
children
the
same
age
in
the
end
scene
as
in
any
prior
memory?
why
is
fischer
jr
unsuspicious
about
the
appearance
of
saito
his
company's
biggest
competitor
in
level
2
when
he
has
been
warned
before
by
mr
charles
that
his
subconscious
is
endangered
by
intruders?
if
the
air
hostess
was
clearly
in
on
the
first
class
setup
why
did
cobb
have
to
sneak
the
drug
into
the
drink?
it's
almost
impossible
to
keep
track
of
who's
in
whose
mind
when
does
it
matter?
how
did
cobb
and
saito
end
up
in
the
same
limbo?
why
not
each
their
own?
what
is
the
significance
of
the
penrose
stairs
in
relation
to
the
structure
and
meaning
of
the
movie?
the
last
kick
we
see
(the
van
falling
off
the
edge)
wakes
everyone
but
cobb
and
saito
up
(who
are
in
limbo)
but
then
they're
all
seen
breathing
in
the
van
for
a
while
how
did
they
suddenly
get
back
to
the
plane?
how
come
when
the
van
drives
off
the
bridge
in
level
one
the
dream
is
in
zero
gravity
in
level
two
but
the
dream
in
level
three
has
perfectly
normal
gravity?
how
is
the
dream
machine
brought
to
deeper
dream
levels?
in
order
to
be
woken
up
from
a
dream
you
have
to
be
kicked
from
the
level
above
so
how
does
ariadne
kick
herself
out
of
limbo?
why
did
ariadne
go
to
the
levels
above
when
she
killed
herself
while
in
limbo
instead
of
waking
up
completely
like
cobb
did?
how
much
time
was
on
the
second
level
when
saito
was
being
extracted?
it
says
that
it's
different
with
heavy
sedation
is
it
possible
that
fischer's
father
did
in
fact
want
him
to
be
his
own
man
and
split
up
the
company
but
never
got
the
chance
to
tell
him
before
he
died?

how
did

get

in
all
the
dream
invasion
stuff

edithistorydelete
although
this
is
never
made
explicit
one
might
infer
that
mal
and
cobb
were
engaged
in
dream
exploration
together
before
mal's
death
after
her
death
cobb
was
forced
to
use
his
knowledge
of
dreams
to
become
a
thief
it
might
also
be
because
miles
(michael
caine)
is
her
father
(cobb's
fatherinlaw)
and
it
was
stated
in
the
movie
that
he
trained
cobb
to
navigate
the
mind
so
it's
pretty
fair
to
say
that
miles
trained
his
own
daughter
as
well
how
do
the
neverending
staircases
work
and
how
was
arthur
able
to
use
one
without
ariadne
as
the
architect
there
to
alter
the
architecture?
edithistorydelete
everyone
can
build
and
alter
their
own
dream
but
not
everyone
can
build
a
perfect
maze
the
role
of
the
architect
is
to
design
a
dream
environment
as
a
perfect
maze
for
each
mission
(hence
the
first
maze
test
sequence)
they
then
explain
the
design
to
the
team
member
who
is
going
to
be
the
dreamer
(hence
the
sequence
with
the
miniatures)
the
one
that
actually
is
dreaming
in
the
hotel
is
arthur
so
he
could
alter
his
dream
anyway
he
wants
to
arthur
was
also
the
one
who
explained
the
concept
of
the
neverending
staircase
(known
as
penrose's
paradox)
to
ariadne
so
she
could
incorporate
it
into
the
levels
what
causes
the
loss
of
gravity
in
the
hotel
dream
world?
edithistorydelete
as
it
is
in
real
life
the
dreamer's
dream
can
be
affected
by
things
happening
outside
the
dream
if
it
gets
cold
while
you're
sleeping
sometimes
people
dream
of
ice
or
snow
if
a
person
falls
out
of
bed
sometimes
they'll
dream
of
skydiving
or
falling
in
their
dream
so
when
the
van
in
the
dream
level
above
the
hotel
falls
off
the
bridge
the
equilibrium
of
those
inside
the
van
is
thrown
off
and
that
feeling
of
falling
carries
over
into
the
dream
making
it
as
though
there's
no
gravity
in
the
hotel
level
below
the
van
this
effect
does
not
however
seem
to
extend
any
further
than
one
level
in
a
dream
within
a
dream
within
a
dream
another
theory
might
be
that
both
arthur

eames
aren't
affected
equally
while
arthur

his
dream
world
are
easily
affected
by
the
loss
of
gravity
eames
is
much
more
immune
to
such
influences
or
he's
actually
well
trained
himself
as
he
must
keep
his
environment
as
controlled
as
possible
when
he
fex
needs
to
portray
as
other
persons
there
seems
to
be
some
effect
of
yusuf
driving
through
the
barrier
(
the
loss
of
gravity
in
the
hotel)
inside
eames'
dream
however
when
team's
surprised
by
the
sudden
avalanche
eames
suggests
that
the
effect
of
events
is
weakened
when
propagating
through
multiple
dream
levels
at
level
2
when
a
vibration
is
felt
in
the
elevator
saito
asks
eames
whether
that
was
caused
by
turbulence
on
the
plane
to
which
eames
answers
that
it's
much
closer
and
indeed
the
next
scene
shows
the
van
which
is
chased
arthur
blows
up
an
elevator
to
create
gravity
why
and
how
does
that
work?
edithistorydelete
the
original
plan
is
to
have
the
floor
of
the
hotel
room
drop
out
from
underneath
the
dreamers
and
thus
provide
the
'kick'
that
wakes
them
up

specifically
eames
who
is
'hosting'
the
dream
in
the
snowy
mountains
this
is
supposed
to
happen
before
the
van
plows
through
the
barrier
and
off
the
bridge
however
the
timing
is
thrown
off
and
now
that
arthur's
body
is
in
freefall
in
the
van
it
translates
into
his
dream
of
the
hotel

thus
preventing
the
floor
from
dropping
once
the
explosives
discharge
he
improvises
a
kick
by
moving
everyone
into
the
lift
and
then
setting
off
an
explosive
to
cause
the
lift
to
start
moving
up
the
shaft
(this
works
much
like
a
rocket
on
a
space
craft)
to
those
in
the
lift
the
force
of
the
lift
pushing
them
is
equivalent
to
gravity
gravity
alone
is
not
enough
to
awaken
the
dreamers
but
when
the
lift
hits
the
roof
at
the
top
of
the
shaft
the
sudden
stopping
or
slowingdown
causes
the
dreamers
to
first
be
propelled
upwards
and
then
fall
back
to
the
floor
the
result
is
the
same
as
the
inner
ear
only
detects
the
acceleration
due
to
a
force
acting
on
the
body
much
like
eames'
demonstration
of
tipping
arthur's
chair
over
to
wake
him
up
after
he's
shot
and
killed
they
resuscitate
fischer
jr
why
couldn't
they
save
saito
in
the
same
way?
edithistorydelete
saito
is
shot
on
the
first
level
of
the
dream
but
dies
on
the
third
level
and
enters
limbo
minutes
before
ariadne
leaves
limbo
therefore
there
isnt
enough
time
to
find
saito
and
kick
his
consciousness
back
to
level
3
for
eames
to
resuscitate
him
even
if
they
manage
to
resuscitate
him
on
the
third
level
the
kick
on
third
level
would
bring
him
back
to
the
second
where
he
was
still
dying
and
if
he
survived
that
the
kick
on
the
second
level
would
still
bring
him
back
to
the
first
where
he
was
dying
the
fastest
anyway
in
the
end
he
still
goes
back
to
limbo
meanwhile
since
fischer
was
shot
on
the
third
level
and
sent
to
limbo
his
bodies
on
the
other
two
levels
were
totally
fine
ariadne
pushed
him
off
the
building
in
limbo
(level
4)
to
provide
him
a
kick
in
conjunction
with
eames
using
the
defibrillator
in
level
3
to
bring
fischer
back
to
life
in
order
to
complete
the
mission
if
she
had
just
shot
him
again
down
in
limbo
he
will
end
up
in
limbo
again
aren't
you
supposed
to
be
alone
in
limbo?
why
are
cobb's
projections
of
his
wife
and
kids
there?
edithistorydelete
limbo
is
an
infinite
dream
place
of
shared
subconsciousness
it
only
contains
things
you've
built
in
it
or
what
you
intended
there
to
be
which
could
explain
why
limbo
has
so
few
projections
when
you're
there
too
long
the
mind
starts
to
think
its
real
that's
why
it's
dangerous
cobb
said
before
never
recreate
from
your
memory
always
imagine
new
placesdreams
feel
real
while
we're
in
them
it's
only
when
we
wake
up
that
we
realize
something
was
actually
strange
(the
machine
allows
you
to
share
dream
space
with
others
but
since
only
cobb
and
mal
been
to
there
so
the
place
is
filled
with
things
created
by
both
of
them
ariadne
is
new
so
there's
none
of
her
projections
in
there)
the
projection
of
his
wife
is
something
he
tells
mal
at
the
end
that
he's
tried
to
recreate
over
time
(by
storing
memories
of
her
in
his
mind)
so
they
could
still
be
together
in
dreams
therefore
it
could
be
that
she's
actually
an
intentional
creation
of
his
out
of
love
and
guilt
similarly
saito
could
have
created
the
guards
which
populate
his
limbo
saito
has
spent
many
years
being
a
powerful
businessman
and
would
be
used
to
having
security
of
some
form
or
another
around
him
cobb's
children
are
always
on
his
mind
just
like
mal
but
by
the
time
he
is
in
limbo
at
the
beginning/end
he
has
cleared
his
mind
of
mal
but
not
his
children
so
the
momentary
projection
of
cobb's
children
could
be
that
he
misses
them
so
much
and
wanted
to
see
them
again
since
he
didn't
see
his
kids
one
last
time
before
he
left
if
the
world
with
crumbling
buildings
is
cobb's
limbo
what
is
the
place
he
ends
up
in
with
saito?
edithistorydelete
the
decaying
world
was
not
cobb's
limbo
it
was
simply
limbo
as
stated
earlier
in
the
movie
limbo
is
unconstructed
dream
space
think
of
it
as
a
dreamvacuum
where
nothing
exists
and
a
dreamers
grasp
on
reality
can
be
lost
this
is
why
it
is
so
dangerous
and
feared
by
the
team
the
reason
it
was
filled
with
cobb
and
mal's
city
was
because
cobb
had
spent
50
years
there
as
with
other
dream
levels
each
state
of
dreaming
is
filled
with
projections
and
places
from
each
of
the
current
dreamers
minds
having
spent
so
much
time
there
cobb
filled
limbo
with
his
dreammemories
of
his
and
mal's
previous
limbo
city
after
mal
dies
in
their
apartment
cobb
wakes
up
on
the
beach
once
again
this
time
near
a
pagodalike
palace
where
he
finds
old
saito
the
jump
from
one
place
to
another
can
be
explained
by
a
previous
scene
in
the
movie
where
cobb
tells
ariadne
that
often
in
dreams
you
jump
from
one
place
to
another
not
knowing
how
you
got
there
alternatively
the
jump
can
also
be
explained
by
cobb
drowning
to
his
death
in
the
first
level
of
dream
thus
ending
up
in
limbo
the
reason
the
palace
is
here
in
this
part
of
limbo
is
because
saito
and
cobb
had
spent
time
there
during
the
audition
extraction
that
cobb
and
his
previous
team
did
for
saito
saito
now
occupies
this
palace
in
limbo
where
he
has
been
stuck
for
many
years
why
is
saito
so
much
older
than
cobb
in
limbo?
edithistorydelete
chronologically
saito
entered
limbo
before
cobb
did
so
it
makes
sense
that
saito
should
have
aged
more
than
cobb
another
theory
is
that
cobb
entered
limbo
twice
the
first
time
was
with
ariadne
they
found
fischer
and
kicked
him
back
to
eames'
dream
meanwhile
saito
dies
and
goes
to
limbo
cobb
provokes
mal
into
attacking
him
(note

he
provoked
her
very
methodically
this
was
a
conscious
choice
he
made
for
some
reason
and
this
theory
is
one
explanation
for
it)
mal
dies
from
ariadne's
gunshot
wound
and
cobb
dies
from
mal's
knife
wound
at
this
point
cobb
is
currently
dying
in
all
3
levels
(in
3
crushed
by
the
exploding
snow
fortress
in
2
in
the
crashing
elevator
in
1
left
to
drown
in
the
van)
when
he
dies
in
limbo
he
wakes
up
in
one
of
(all
of?)
these
levels
and
dies
again
sending
him
to
limbo
and
washing
up
on
the
shore
near
saito's
palace
saito
having
been
in
limbo
this
whole
time
has
aged
decades
while
cobb
is
just
arriving
to
limbo
for
the
2nd
time
a
second
perspective
as
to
why
saito
is
older
is
that
limbo
is
formed
around
the
raw
subconscious
during
the
helicopter
scene
saito
relates
to
cobb
his
personal
fear
of
becoming
an
old
man
filled
with
regret
and
this
is
the
form
that
saito
takes
in
his
limbo
his
age
does
not
reflect
the
time
in
the
various
levels
of
dreams
with
this
in
mind
the
flashbacks
of
cobb
and
mal
in
their
old
age
perhaps
did
not
reflect
them
becoming
old
in
limbo
rather
it
was
real
memories
of
themselves
if
the
top
really
does
keep
spinning
at
the
end
and
cobb's
reality
really
is
a
dream
then
why
didn't
it
keep
spinning
when
he
tried
it
earlier
in
the
film?
edithistorydelete
we
are
shown
three
totems
in
the
movie
the
spinning
top
arthur's
weighted
die
and
ariadne's
detachable
chess
piece
when
totems
are
explained
arthur
refuses
to
let
ariadne
touch
his
totem
as
assuring
only
the
owner
knows
the
'proper
feel'
of
the
totem
assures
it
can
never
be
faked
by
another
in
a
dream
if
they
did
attempt
to
fake
the
totem
they
could
recreate
only
its
appearance
and
it
would
not
'feel'
right
we
are
shown
this
ability
to
perceive
mistakes
when
saito
knew
the
carpet
on
his
apartment
floor
was
not
recreated
correctly
in
the
opening
scene
given
this
explanation
how
long
the
top
spins
is
not
a
good
totem
since
it
is
something
someone
else
can
easily
see
and
thus
recreate
paradoxically
the
author
chooses
the
spinning
top
for
our
benefit
as
it
is
the
only
totem
the
audience
can
evaluate
adding
suspicion
to
the
totem
cobb
admits
to
acquiring
it
from
mal
we
are
shown
later
that
the
spinning
top
is
a
significant
part
of
cobb
and
mal's
limbo
and
thus
it's
possible
that
cobb
acquired
it
from
mal
during
their
limbo
dream
and
thus
he
never
had
any
realworld
totem
at
all
these
facts
considered
together
point
to
the
possibility
that
the
spinning
top
is
not
a
trustworthy
totem
at
any
point
in
the
movie
assuming
for
a
moment
that
cobb
is
still
in
the
dream
when
the
movie
ends
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
he
was
in
a
dream
for
the
entire
film
the
cobb
we
see
at
the
end
could
in
fact
be
a
man
still
trapped
in
the
final
limbo
the
last
time
cobb's
top
falls
over
occurs
early
in
the
movie
when
he
visits
mumbasa
implying
to
the
audience
that
he
is
not
in
a
dream
at
that
point
however
the
movie
never
shows
us
how
he
gets
out
of
the
final
limbo
he
simply
seems
to
wake
up
on
the
airplane
with
saito
our
understanding
is
that
escaping
limbo
should
be
very
difficult
yet
when
they
wake
up
on
the
plane
saito
does
move
as
if
he's
reaching
for
a
gun
which
could
be
meant
to
suggest
they
killed
themselves
to
escape
and
that
they
have
really
escaped
the
dream
a
second
theory
is
that
the
entire
movie
could
be
a
dream
if
cobb
did
acquire
the
totem
from
mal
during
their
limbo
(or
alternately
if
the
flaw
in
using
the
spinning
top
as
a
totem
is
a
character
mistake
and
not
a
device
for
the
audience)
then
he
also
has
no
way
to
judge
whether
he
is
in
a
dream
or
not
mal
may
have
been
right
in
believing
they
were
still
in
a
dream
in
this
case
it
may
have
fallen
over
because
it
is
cobb's
own
dream
and
he
wishes
to
believe
it
is
reality
and
thus
makes
it
so
alternately
the
mal
that
killed
herself
may
not
have
been
mal
at
all
but
a
projection
attempting
to
help
cobb
realize
he
needed
to
wake
up
in
this
latter
case
'inception'
never
occurred
at
all
tying
into
the
common
belief
that
it
is
not
possible
a
third
theory
is
that
through
the
spinning
top
in
the
end
sequence
nolan
is
showing
the
idea

'incepting
it'
in
our
consciousness
if
you
will

that
the
whole
of
what
we
think
of
'reality'
is
in
fact
a
dream
this
spiritual
idea
was
shared
by
plato
in
his
allegory
of
the
cave
and
is
shared
by
some
hindu
and
buddhist
traditions
the
terms
nolan
uses
in
the
film
suggest
he
is
drawing
strongly
on
the
metaphysics
given
in
'a
course
in
miracles'
this
modernday
channeled
text

purportedly
from
jesus

has
heavily
influenced
many
current
spiritual
teachers
and
counts
oprah
winfrey
deepak
chopra
and
louise
hay
amongst
its
fans
it
suggests
that
we
live
in
a
dream
reality
peopled
by
projections
of
our
own
unconscious
guilt
and
have
buried
deep
within
our
minds
the
truth
that
we
are
innocent

only
dreaming
a
dream
of
guilt
separation
and
fear
the
key
to
escaping
this
mental
prison
says
'a
course
in
miracles'
is
forgiveness
(just
as
ariadne
tells
cobb)
it
describes
the
dream
as
being
regularly
penetrated
by
'an
ancient
melody'
of
forgiveness
and
innocence
as
we
dimly
remember
'home'
a
metaphor
that
nolan
apparently
alludes
to
in
inception
through
the
wakeup
song
'je
ne
regrette
rien'
(no
regrets)
still
the
totem
*is*
flawed
in
that
someone
could
recreate
a
lookalike
top
and
only
mal
(deceased)
would
know
all
the
nuances
of
it
and
correct
weight
in
specific
parts
to
determine
a
real
from
a
fake
(and
hence
dream
from
reality)
i
suppose
cobb
could
have
since
learned
the
weight
of
it
however
arthur
doesn't
let
ariadne
touch
his
totem
for
just
that
reason
why
is
the
limbo
at
the
end
of
the
film
filled
with
cobb
and
mal's
city?
edithistorydelete
limbo
is
a
shared
environment
not
limited
to
a
single
subconscious
it
is
referred
to
earlier
in
the
film
as
unconstructed
dream
space
it
is
filled
with
cobb's
decaying
city
because
he
is
the
only
one
in
the
group
who
has
experienced
limbo
before
had
cobb
not
spent
50
years
there
it
would
have
supposedly
been
empty
space
a
second
theory
is
the
city
is
the
remains
of
what
cobb
and
mal
had
created
when
sato
died
from
the
gun
shot
wound
he
entered
the
limbo
in
which
cobb
and
mal
had
been
some
say
that
it
is
not
limbo
and
that
it
is
cobb's
dream
(for
how
can
cobb
and
ariadne
purposely
put
themselves
in
limbo)
a
point
to
refute
this
is
that
fischer
was
in
it
but
maybe
he
was
just
a
projection
mal
is
a
projection
why
couldn't
fischer?
while
entering
a
new
dream
level
how
do
the
characters
in
the
shared
dream
know
they're
in
a
dream?
how
do
they
know
what
they
are
supposed
to
do?
edithistorydelete
cobb
says
at
one
point
that
remembering
what
happened
in
a
dream
takes
years
of
experience
it
can
be
assumed
that
this
also
works
conversely
remembering
what
happened
in
reality
when
entering
a
dream
it
is
made
apparent
throughout
the
film
that
the
dreamers
are
fully
aware
of
what
they're
doing
because
they've
trained
ahead
of
time
many
of
the
whys
in
the
film
can
be
explained
simply
because
the
dreamers
are
professionals
and
have
training

experience
imagine
if
you
will
that
you
could
predict
what
dream
you
were
going
to
have
tonight
and
you
could
prepare
for
it
when
you
arrived
in
the
dream
you
would
be
aware
what
it
was
because
you
have
prepared
yourself
for
it
throughout
the
film
cobb's
team
prepares
thoroughly
for
the
inception
job
they
study
ariadne's
models
(with
the
exception
of
cobb)
they
go
through
the
scenarios
etc
by
the
time
they
are
actually
ready
to
enter
the
dreams
they
have
fully
prepared
their
minds
for
what
they're
about
to
experience
and
their
minds
can
thus
recognize
the
reality
that
they
are
in
a
dream
while
fischer
on
the
other
hand
has
not
had
any
prior
knowledge
of
this
and
can
thus
be
fooled
by
the
illusion
what
significance
did
the
numbers
on
the
piece
of
paper
that
eames
gives
fischer
jr
have?
edithistorydelete
these
numbers
(528491)
were
the
same
ones
that
fischer
jr
randomly
came
up
with
for
the
team
when
he
was
being
held
hostage
just
as
a
safe
created
by
an
architect
can
be
filled
with
a
dreamer's
secrets
so
too
can
the
safe
be
set
to
unlock
with
the
dreamer's
own
numbers
by
taking
fischer
jr
to
a
second
dream
level
his
subconscious
is
able
to
interpret
a
string
of
numbers
that
was
random
on
the
first
as
being
significant
on
the
second
and
finally
the
actual
combination
on
the
third
eames
(projected
as
a
blonde
woman)
gives
fischer
jr
the
numbers
so
that
he
can
have
further
rehearsal
with
them
and
internalize
them
further
cobb
exploits
this
and
forces
additional
rehearsal
when
he
asks
fischer
to
figure
out
the
room
to
search
for
extractors
the
rest
of
his
team

already
at

room

exited

ventures

all
never
come
from

interviews

edithistorydelete
nolan
has
said
multiple
times
that
one
of
his
favorite
quotes
that
have
inspired
him
to
make
this
movie
is
just
that
in
many
other
interviews
he
says
that
although
this
is
a
completely
original
idea
there
are
causes
of
inspiration
for
everything
he's
done
this
explains
the
whole
premise
of

is
a
big
symbol
of
how
our
lives
are
all
made
up
of
tiny
little
inceptions
(or

caused

what
is
the
significance
of
the
song
non
je
ne
regrette
rien?
edithistorydelete
non
je
ne
regrette
rien
is
the
signature
song
of
the
french
songstress
&eacutedith
piaf
(19151963)
the
song
was
written
for
piaf
in
1956
by
charles
dumont
and
michel
vaucaire
and
recorded
by
piaf
in
1960
it
appears
in
her
biography
film
la
m&ocircme
(2007)
(retitled
la
vie
en
rose
for
englishlanguage
release)
and
its
title
translates
into
english
as
no
i
regret
nothing
in
inception
non
je
ne
regrette
rien
is
used
to
signal
the
various
characters
that
it
is
time
to
wake
up
and/or
kick
up
into
a
higher
dream
level
it's
an
appropriate
song
for
inception
because
of
the
theme
of
regret
that
weaves
through
the
film
according
to
the
wall
street
journal
christopher
nolan
the
writer
and
director
of
inception
had
incorporated
the
use
of
this
song
into
the
script
from
early
on
marion
cotillard
who
plays
mal
also
portrayed
piaf
in
la
vie
en
rose
(and
won
an
academy
award
for
it)
which
caused
nolan
to
seriously
consider
taking
the
song
out
before
convinced
by
hans
zimmer
to
keep
it
the
melody
of
non
je
ne
regrette
rien
is
also
echoed
in
the
score
of
inception
by
being
slowed
down
was
the
end
a
dream
or
reality?
edithistorydelete
although
no
one
can
prove
it
one
way
or
another
unless
that
person
is
chris
nolan
it
is
hard
to
say
both
theories
are
possible
evidence
to
reality
if
we
accept
that
the
entire
movie
is
not
a
dream
and
that
cobb
did
in
fact
escape
his
limbo
with
mal
then
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
he
also
escaped
his
limbo
with
saito
also
there
are
simple
explanations
as
to
why
when
he
sees
his
kids
again
they
look
much
like
they
did
in
his
dream
for
example
he
never
saw
his
kids
faces
so
we
cannot
easily
tell
if
they
had
aged
much
from
his
memory
in
addition
the
movie
never
defines
the
amount
of
time
that
has
passed
since
mal
had
died
and
cobb
was
banned
from
the
us
so
the
memory
of
his
kids
may
only
be
a
few
months
old
therefore
it
is
very
possible
his
kids
look
pretty
much
the
same
in
the
memories
and
in
the
present
in
addition
the
visual
duration
of
the
top
spinning
is
never
a
trustworthy
totem
at
all
since
it
is
a
property
of
the
totem
others
can
observe
and
recreate
if
the
top
is
to
be
trustworthy
at
all
it
is
cobb's
knowledge
of
how
it
feels
to
spin
it
that
convinces
him
he
is
awake
not
the
duration
of
the
spinning
which
we
can
presume
will
end
eventually
in
the
final
scene
visually
there
is
an
obvious
difference
between
the
wobbly
spinning
in
the
endscene
and
the
absolutely
perfect
spin
in
the
safe
during
limbo
again
implying
the
possibility
that
the
final
spin
could
be
natural
(though
only
the
feel
in
cobb's
fingers
would
know
for
sure)
it
is
alleged
that
at
the
end
of
the
film
cobb's
children
are
wearing
different
albeit
similar
clothing
compared
to
the
clothes
they
wear
in
cobb's
subconscious
in
the
opening
scene
dream
you
get
a
glimpse
of
cobb's
hand
he's
wearing
his
wedding
ring
now
if
you
follow
the
rest
of
the
movie
keeping
an
eye
out
for
this
you
will
notice
that
he
only
has
the
ring
on
when
he's
allegedly
in
a
dream
at
the
end
of
the
movie
he
isn't
wearing
the
ring
if
the
ring
only
appears
when
he's
in
a
dream
and
he's
not
wearing
at
the
end
of
the
film
that
could
be
confirmation
that
in
fact
he
woke
up
evidence
to
dream
it
is
possible
that
the
entire
movie
is
a
dream
and
that
cobb
never
left
his
own
limbo
the
children
appear
the
same
age
as
in
a
previous
memory
and
in
fact
appear
to
have
the
same
motions
and
same
clothes
in
the
yard
before
turning
around
it
suggests
to
the
viewer
that
this
is
exactly
the
same
as
his
memory
and
thus
he
could
be
still
dreaming
how
long
the
top
spins
is
not
a
good
totem
except
in
that
it
spinning
forever
is
only
possible
in
the
dream
world
a
shortduration
spin
is
a
visual
property
that
someone
could
easily
recreate
in
a
dream
if
we
trust
the
spinning
top
it
must
be
the
exact
feel
in
cobb's
fingers
as
he
spins
it
that
convinces
him
it
is
genuine
however
cobb
admits
that
the
totem
was
originally
mal's
totem
suggesting
that
he
adopted
it
as
his
totem
during
limbo
making
it
impossible
for
him
to
know
the
true
feel
in
addition
a
totem
can
not
prove
that
you've
woken
up
from
your
own
dream
since
you
know
it's
true
'feel'
and
thus
your
subconscious
can
recreate
it
properly[/spoiler]
also
this
may
be
a
continutity
error
but
when
arthur
comes
to
get
cobb
in
tokyo
they
leave
the
hotel
room
and
go
to
the
roof
for
the
helicopter
at
night
when
they're
on
the
roof
it's
day
both
theories
are
true
theory
movie
has
two
main
themes
the
first
one
is
that
the
line
between
dreams
and
reality
can
be
imperceptible
from
the
perspective
of
an
individual
the
second
that
an
idea
can
be
a
parasite
which
once
incepted
can
take
over
one's
psyche
the
ending
simply
reflects
the
fact
that
the
idea
that
killed
mal
has
now
taken
over
cobb
he
cannot
discern
whether
he
is
now
living
in
a
dream
or
a
reality
and
we
the
audience
witness
that
intimately
the
gyro
in
the
end
falters
but
we
do
not
see
whether
it
stops
or
not
have
we
witnessed
it
stop
the
movie
would
be
essentially
telling
us
fear
not
this
is
real
and
a
happy
end
had
the
shot
ended
with
it
spinning
the
movie
would
affirm
the
other
theory
however
the
shot
asis
wants
to
ensure
us
that
we
do
not
know
and
we
cannot
know
because
cobb
doesn't
know
anymore
the
lack
of
definite
answer
is
the
answer
for
the
rest
of
his
life
cobb
will
wonder
whether
everything
around
him
is
real
and
the
audience
is
deliberately
left
with
that
same
question
hanging
in
their
heads
notice
that
when
cobb
is
in
his
memory
bank
with
ariadne
cobb
is
looking
out
the
window
at
his
kids
he
tells
ariadne
that
his
greatest
regret
is
not
being
able
to
alter
this
moment
and
see
his
children's
beautiful
faces
again
that
would
imply
that
was
cobb's
inception
to
himself
he
finally
did
what
he
could
never
do
before
and
altered
the
moment
in
which
he
saw
his
children
and
he
sees
their
faces
also
why
was
miles
there?
he
was
living
in
france
yet
was
waiting
at
the
airport
in
the
states
(reason
why
miles
was
there
when
cobb
visitied
miles
it
was
to
give
him
a
gift
for
his
children
ie
miles
was
traveling
to
see
cobb's
children
in
the
near
future
and
obviously
cobb
could
and
would
have
made
arrangements
with
miles
when
he
knew
he
was
coming
back
to
america)
even
more
confusing
miles'
wife
mal's
mother
was
taking
care
of
cobb's
children
in
america
yet
we
never
see
her
at
the
house
at
the
end

the
inception
itself
could
be
altering
his
biggest
regrets
which
spreads
to
every
aspect
of
his
life
he
winds
up
needing
to
alter
or
mal
was
right
the
whole
time
and
he
was
actually
still
down
one
dream
level
and
mal
is
alive
in
reality
and
cobb
wasn't
waking
up
the
spiritual
/
metaphysical
explanation
from
a
spiritual
perspective
there
is
a
different
reading
again
this
movie
is
one
with
a
profound
spiritual
idea
at
its
heart
for
those
interested

just
as
with
'the
matrix'
and
guy
ritchie's
'revolver'
in
'inception'
nolan
seems
to
be
using
the
metaphysics
given
in
'a
course
in
miracles'
a
seminal
spiritual
text
from
the
1970s
that
was
purportedly
channelled
from
jesus
and
which
continues
to
profoundly
influence
modern
spiritual
thinking
in
acim
the
key
idea
is
that
what
we
think
of
as
reality
is
in
fact
a
dream

that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
dreams
we
see
at
night
and
what
we
see
with
our
eyes
open
both
are
projections
of
our
mind
which
is
trying
to
escape
a
core
guilt
by
projecting
guilt
outside
of
itself
onto
projected
'dream
figures'
[spoiler](for
more
on
this
see
the
faq
titled
'if
the
spinning
top
really
did
keep
spinning
at
the
end')
thus
although
cobb
returned
to
'reality'
nolan
seems
to
be
making
the
point
that
what
we
think
of
as
'reality'
is
still
a
dream
and
that
within
that
dream
we
see
what
we
want
to
see

projection
makes
perception
thus
the
movie
is
devised
so
that
some
viewers
look
at
the
spinning
top
and
see
it
as
being
about
to
fall
over
as
the
movie
ends
they
decide
that
the
movie
is
saying
that
cobb
is
back
in
'reality'
and
not
dreaming
others
see
the
top
as
going
to
continue
spinning
indefinitely
but
one
then
inevitably
asks
how
could
cobb
be
still
in
a
dream?
which
leads
us
to
think
hard
to
debate
to
share
ideas
and
perhaps
eventually
to
question
the
unquestionable

that
'reality'
is
not
what
it
seems
to
be
nolan
is
cleverly
sowing
a
key
idea
in
our
consciousness
so
you
could
say
the
movie
inception
is
in
itself
an
inception!
within
this
interpretative
framework
nolan
is
reaching
to
us
within
the
'dream'
that
we
call
reality
to
help
us
to
start
to
challenge
our
assumptions
about
'reality'
and
begin
to
wake
up

just
as
cobb
went
into
limbo
to
get
saito
yet
for
an
inception
to
work
one
must
accept
it
as
one's
own
thought
process
so
of
course
nolan
does
not
give
interviews
where
he
says
'this
is
a
movie
where
i'm
trying
to
wake
people
up
to
the
fact
that
they're
dreaming'
what
is
the
significance
of
the
name
ariadne?
edithistorydelete
in
greek
mythology
she
was
considered
the
mistress
of
the
labyrinth
in
the
legend
of
theseus
and
the
minotaur
ariadne
()
was
a
princess
of
crete
and
her
father
(the
king)
created
a
labyrinth
with
a
minotaur
inside
it
every
year
seven
men
and
seven
women
would
have
to
be
sacrificed
to
it
one
year
a
hero
named
theseus
offered
to
kill
the
minotaur
and
ariadne
fell
in
love
with
him
so
she
gave
him
a
ball
of
string
before
he
entered
the
labyrinth
as
well
as
directions
theseus
was
able
to
kill
the
minotaur
and
took
ariadne
for
his
bride
in
some
accounts
of
the
myth
theseus
later
abandoned
ariadne
on
the
island
of
naxos
where
she
was
discovered
and
rescued
by
the
god
dionysus
ariadne
eventually
became
the
wife
of
dionysus
and
joined
the
pantheon
of
gods
on
mount
olympus
this
song
can
also
be
read
as
backing
the
theory
that
'inception'
follows
the
metaphysics
of
a
course
in
miracles
a
spiritual
text
which
describes
humanity
as
dreaming
the
dream
is
described
in
the
course
as
having
a
flavour
or
underlying
allpervasive
guilt

just
as
cobb
tells
adriadne
he
experiences
truth
says
acim
is
buried
deep
in
the
dreamer's
unconscious
mind
(cf
mal's
safe)
and
spirit
tries
to
wake
us
up
to
our
innocence
through
what
is
metaphorically
described
as
'an
ancient
melody'
that
speaks
of
our
innocence

(cf
'je
ne
regrette
rien'
as
the
call
to
wake
up
throughout
the
movie)
cobb
is
told
by
ariadne
that
the
key
to
him
undoing
the
nightmarish
situation
in
which
he
is
entrapped
with
mal
is
forgiveness
and
so
'mal'
('bad
/
evil'
in
french
and
spanish)
is
undone
by
forgiveness
cobb
forgives
both
mal
and
himself
releases
his
regrets
and
so
heals
his
past
(another
key
theme
of
acim)
thus
in
the
movie
ariadne
serves
as
the
'mistress
of
the
labyrinth'
both
in
the
obvious
sense
of
devising
dream
labyrinthine
architecture
and
in
the
more
subtle
sense
of
leading
cobb
out
of
his
mental
imprisonment
what
were
the
dream
layers
in
order?
edithistorydelete
1
the
city
(yusuf's
dream)
2
the
hotel
(arthur's
dream)
3
the
mountain
(eames'
dream)
4
limbo
(the
decaying
city

the
asian
house
where
cobb
finds
saito)
if
cobb

mal
aged
50
years
in
limbo
why
were
they
young
again
on
the
train
tracks?
edithistorydelete
this
is
a
storytelling
device
as
cobb
tells
the
story
the
audience
and
ariadne
both
imagine
cobb
and
mal
as
they
are
young

the
only
way
we
know
them
because
it
is
from
ariadne's/our
point
of
view
when
cobb
reminds
mal
that
they
did
grow
old
together
and
we
see
them
as
they
really
were
in
his
memory
walking
together
as
older
people
finally
we
see
their
aged
hands
clasped
together
shaking
as
they
lay
by
the
train
tracks
it
is
then
we
realize
how
that
final
scene
really
was
in
cobb's
memory
and
we
understand
the
full
life
that
they
have
shared
how
do
the
dreamers
fall
asleep
so
fast?
edithistorydelete
it
is
not
explicitly
explained
the
device
used
to
enter
dreams
connects
to
the
wrist
of
the
people
using
it
but
it
does
not
appear
to
be
intravenous
(iv)
specifically
there
is
never
any
evidence
of
puncture
marks
blood
spots
or
gauze/bandages
after
saito
wakes
from
his
dream
on
the
train
he
feels
his
wrist
which
shows
no
evidence
of
needle
puncture
etc
the
machine
is
a
plot
device
that
somehow
allows
the
experience
of
shared
subconscious
during
dreaming
and
it
also
apparently
rapidly
induces
rem
sleep
(the
phase
of
sleep
in
which
dreaming
takes
place)
it
also
maintains
this
rem
state
for
the
duration
of
its
activation
obviously
necessary
for
the
extraction
missions
the
science
or
mechanism
behind
these
features
of
the
machine
are
not
explained
presumably
as
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
actual
plot
an
example
of
a
plausible
explanation
may
involve
the
use
of
electromagnetic
pulses
to
stimulate
rapid
onset
of
rem
but
this
is
pure
speculation
how
did
cobb
and
mal
enter
limbo?
edithistorydelete
cobb
says
that
he
and
mal
were
exploring
the
theory
of
a
dreamwithinadream
he
wanted
to
go
deeper
and
deeper
and
they
ended
up
getting
lost
in
limbo
it
is
also
implied
that
the
more
layers
deep
you
go
the
more
unstable
the
dreams
become
and
that
3layers
deep
is
needed
for
inception
(3layers+
is
rarely
if
ever
done)
knowing
all
these
facts
stated
clearly
throughout
the
film
it
can
be
assumed
that
anything
over
3layers
deep
could
potentially
send
the
dreamer
to
limbo
apparently
this
is
what
happened
to
cobb
and
mal
was
the
decaying
city
limbo
or
was
it
cobb's
dream?
edithistorydelete
there
are
2
main
theories
(1)
limbo
when
fischer
and
saito
died
in
eames'
dream
(the
snow
fortress)
they
both
went
to
limbo
if
the
decaying
city
was
cobb's
dream
fischer
would
not
have
been
there
therefore
both
the
decaying
city
and
saito's
palace
had
to
have
been
limbo
limbo
looks
like
it's
cobb's
dream
because
it
was
made
by
cobb
and
mal
when
they
were
in
limbo
otherwise
limbo
is
an
empty
dream
space
(2)
cobb's
dream
when
fischer
died
in
eames'
dream
ariadne
proposes
that
there
is
a
different
way
she
and
cobb
go
into
yet
another
level
of
dream
when
she
finds
fischer
and
hears
the
signal
in
this
dream
she
throws
him
off
the
ledge
this
is
synched
up
with
eames
using
the
defibrillator
reviving
fischer
and
allowing
him
to
complete
his
realization
of
the
inception
the
problem
with
this
second
theory
is
that
why
and
how
fisher
would
be
in
that
dream
with
cobb
and
ariadne?
he
wasn't
even
hooked
to
the
dream
machine
to
share
it
plus
the
conversation
there
between
cobb
ariadne
and
mal
as
well
as
cobb's
willingness
to
stay
behind
to
find
saito
suggest
that
they
are
in
fact
in
limbo
why
didn't
arthur
wake
up
from
the
first
kick
when
the
van
drove
off
the
bridge?
edithistorydelete
due
to
the
sedative
a
synchronized
multilevel
kick
was
needed
(the
van
freefalling
the
original
plan
for
the
hotel
floor
explosion
and
the
snow
fortress
explosion)
yusuf's
kick
(van
freefall)
was
too
early
due
to
fischer's
projections
attacking
and
thus
the
kicks
weren't
synchronized
this
was
designed
to
ensure
that
the
team
was
able
to
stay
where
they
needed
to
and
finish
the
job
if
one
kick
failed
because
it
wasn't
synchronized
they
could
try
another
while
using
the
musical
countdown
to
warn
the
next
level
that
it
was
coming
earlier
in
the
movie
arthur
tells
ariadne
that
if
yusuf
kicks
too
early
(ie
if
he
drives
the
van
off
the
bridge
before
arthur
has
a
chance
to
kick
the
group
out
of
eames'
dream)
they
won't
wake
up
while
normally
in
order
to
wake
up
you
must
receive
a
kick
in
the
level
above
this
isn't
true
when
using
the
special
sedative
instead
with
the
sedative
it
takes
two
or
more
synchronized
kicks
in
all
levels
simultaneously
arthur
didn't
have
the
second
kick
ready
when
the
van
drove
off
the
bridge
so
he
wasn't
awakened
by
the
van
falling
off
the
bridge
when
the
elevator
hit
the
ground
floor
and
the
group
was
kicked
by
the
freefall
they
were
pulled
out
of
eames'
dream
(the
snow
fortress)
and
simultaneously
pulled
back
into
yusuf's
dream
(the
van)
cobb
and
saito
weren't
kicked
back
up
because
they
were
still
stuck
in
limbo
and
weren't
being
kicked
at
that
moment
so
they
were
left
in
the
van
underwater
still
attached
to
the
dreaming
device
how
did
cobb
and
saito
manage
to
get
back
to
reality
(in
the
plane)?
edithistorydelete
the
inception
mission
is
planned
to
be
about
10
hours
in

the
sedative
was
supposed
to
last
about
10
hours
the
flight
they
were
on

takes
10
hours
according
to
saito
the

was
getting
ready
to
land
when
cobb

up

the
passengers
to
get
ready
for
descent
in
twenty
minutes'
time
presumably
the
time
taken
to
drug
fischer
(after
seat
belt
sign
is
off
so
30

45
min)
time
needed
for
the
drug
to
fully
take
effect
(about
1
hr)
and
time
needed
to
perform
preparation
work
before
the
mission
(10
min)
cobb
drugged
fischer
so
they
could
connect
him
to
the
machine
the
mission
starts
fairly
soon
after
the
plane
takes
off
as
soon
as
the
seatbelt
signs
are
switched
off
let's
not
forget
saito
owns
the
airline
so
normal
procedures
may
not
have
been
followed
due
to
unforeseen
circumstances
(saito
is
injured
and
dying
and
fischer's
subconscious
having
been
trained
by
an
extractor
before)
the
team
needed
to
complete
the
mission
as
fast
as
possible
the
inception
was
successful
after
all
the
kicks
are
synchronized
everyone
other
than
saito
and
cobb
woke
up
on
the
first
level
of
the
dream
evidence
yusuf
is
seen
escaping
from
the
van
in
the
water
but
he's
not
seen
after
that
only
fischer
eames
ariadne
and
arthur
are
shown
on
the
surface
this
is
why
we
saw
ariadne
arthur
eames
and
fischer
all
awake
in
the
plane
when
cobb
wakes
up
since
yusuf
woke
up
instead
of
being
killed
like
arthur
in
the
extraction
mission
the
dream
doesn't
collapse
and
looks
fine
even
if
the
dream
will
collapse
due
to
the
absence
of
the
dreamer
the
dream
could
still
be
momentarily
stable
due
to
the
fact
that
heavy
sedative
is
being
used
in
addition
it
probably
takes
30

40
seconds
for
yusuf
to
wake
up
(due
to
heavy
sedation)
which
gives
10

14
minutes
in
a
level
1
dream
this
leaves
saito
and
cobb
connected
with
the
machine
the
timer
on
the
machine
is
still
in
countdown
the
team
could
probably
hide
the
machine
from
fischer
and
wait
for
the
timer
to
reach
zero
to
unhook
them
from
the
machine
(when
timer
is
zero
it's
either
they
wake
up
or
in
a
coma)
or
it
could
be
the
drug
that
cobb
gave
to
fischer
is
a
strong
sedative
that
made
him
fall
in
deep
sleep
for
a
full
10
hours
and
woke
up
a
few
minutes
after
the
timer
on
the
machine
reaches
zero
but
before
cobb
wakes
up
(the
dream
machine
is
absent
when
cobb
wakes
up
and
his
hand
is
not
hooked
to
a
wire)
when
saito
is
made
aware
that
he
and
cobb
are
in
limbo
they
shoot
themselves
return
to
reality
just
in
time
as
the
timer
reaches
zero
and
the
team
unhooks
them
from
the
machine
however
cobb
and
saito
didn't
wake
up
immediately
since
it
may
take
some
time
for
the
strong
sedative
to
wear
off
(a
few
minutes
later)
what
happens
if
you
die
in
limbo
before
the
sedative
wears
off?
edithistorydelete
for
normal
sedatives
you
just
go
back
to
reality
if
you
become
aware
that
you
are
in
limbo
(as
shown
where
cobb
and
mal
returned
to
reality)
for
strong
sedatives
if
the
timer
in
the
dream
machine
hasn't
expired
you
still
end
up
back
in
limbo
unaware
of
the
fact
that
you're
still
in
there
or
the
awareness
that
it's
a
dream
becomes
vague
if
the
timer
on
the
machine
reaches
zero
and
you've
forgotten
where
you
really
are
you
accept
it
as
reality
(become
older
like
saito
and
die)
you'll
never
go
back
to
reality
as
your
mind
perceives
that
you're
dead
(coma)
evidence
cobb
repeats
what
saito
had
said
at
the
start
of
the
film
someone
from
my
half
remembered
dream
this
means
the
two
scenes
in
the
palace
are
different
and
saito
died
and
back
in
limbo
again
and
again
cobb
i've
come
back
for
you
to
remind
you
somethingsomething
you
once
knew
this
means
that
cobb's
awareness
that
he's
in
limbo
becomes
vague
however
considering
the
fact
that
he's
still
looks
the
same
age
as
he
was
in
reality
he
does
know
that
it's
a
dream
is
mal
in
the
window
after
cobb
wakes
up
from
yusuf's
sedation
test?
edithistorydelete
yes
but
these
are
memories

fresh
in
his
mind
due
to
the
fact
that
he
just
woke
up
from
dreaming
about
the
time
mal
and
he
spent
in
limbo
together
if
you
notice
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
window
is
part
of
yusuf's
bathroom
the
curtains
with
their
warm
glow
are
even
the
same
as
those
in
the
hotel
room
this
is
followed
by
a
closeup
shot
of
mal
sitting
on
the
ledge
of
the
hotel
room
where
she
committed
suicide
these
are
all
fresh
recent
memories
to
cobb
since
he
relives
them
in
his
dream
when
mal
commits
suicide
and
jumps
off
the
ledge
is
the
room
behind
her
trashed?
edithistorydelete
no
the
room
behind
her
is
fine
the
room
she
lured
cobb
to
is
trashed
because
she
is
setting
up
a
crime
scene
that
will
implicate
cobb
in
her
death
she
lures
cobb
to
the
room
across
from
her
so
she
can
try
to
convince
him
to
die
with
her
without
giving
him
any
chance
of
stopping
her
here
she
shows
a
more
sinister
side
if
he
doesn't
join
her
in
jumping
off
the
ledge
willingly
out
of
love
for
her
she
has
made
it
so
he
might
be
pressured
to
jump
unwillingly
to
avoid
being
framed
for
her
murder
and
in
fact
it
is
because
he
doesn't
jump
that
he
ends
up
framed
for
her
murder
which
would
motivate
cobb
to
follow
after
mal
and
commit
suicide
to
avoid
a
life
sentence
so
she
was
hedging
her
bets
so
in
every
scenario
he
would
wind
up
dying
to
join
her
in
what
she
believed
would

mr

what
exactly

edithistorydelete
mr
charles
is
a
gambit
designed
to
alert
the
target
(fischer)
to
turn
against
his
own
subconscious
by
telling
him
that
he's
dreaming
and
pointing
out
the
strangeness
of
it
all
gaining
his
trust
in
order
to
move
forward
with
the

at
hand
as

as

cobb
impersonates
as
mr
charles
a
projection
of
fischer's
subconscious
trained
by
an
extractor
who
comes
to
help
him
to
get
rid
of
the
intruders
this
is
extremely
dangerous
as
this
alerts
fischer's
trained
subconscious
to
be
wellprepared
to
find
the
intruders
and
kill
them
(fischer's
projections
in
the
third
level
down
are
militarized
and
wellarmed)
when
ariadne

she

tell
mal
her
name
but
mal
cuts
her

i

you
are
how
does
mal
know
who
ariadne

edithistorydelete
since
mal
is
cobb's

if
he
knows
her
then
mal
should
know
her
as

if
you're
looking
at
the

metaphysically
mal
('bad'

'evil'

is
the
dream
figure
in
cobbs
mind

symbolises
his
guilt
guilt

undone
by

ariadne
symbolises
innocence
and
forgiveness
and
shares
this
key
with
cobb
telling
him
the
only
way
to
undo
his
guilt
and
free
himself
from
his
dreamhell
is
to
forgive
both
mal
and
himself

why
does

put
all
the
blame

thinks

killed
her?
edithistorydelete
mal
told
cobb
her
plan
to
incriminate
him
if
he
won't
jump
with
her
mal
went
to
3
different
psychologists
to
prove
that
she's
mentally
sane
then
sent
a
letter
to
their
attorney
that
cobb
is
trying
to
kill
her
and
papers

mental

that
mal
had
deliberately
staged
a
struggle
in
the
hotel
room
before
she
jumped
off
the
ledge
of
the
opposite

this
is
why
the

listen
to
cobb's
explanation
that
she's
mentally
unstable
and
conclude
that
he
killed
her
what
is
the
time
frame
for

dream

edithistorydelete

plan
however
it
seems
that
not
even
a
day
has
passed
in
level
1
dream
throughout
the
whole
mission
this
is
due
to
the
unforeseen
circumstances
such
as
fischer's
subconscious
being
trained
(heavily
armed
and
capable
of
finding
the
intruders
quickly)
and
saito
is
hurt
and
dying
so
their
mission
needs
to
be
completed
as
quickly
as
possible
was
ariadne
somehow
aware
of
the
numbers
fischer
would
come
up
with
or
did
she
change
the
hotel's
floor
plan
so
that
491
would
be
below
528?
edithistorydelete
the
team
knew
the
number
beforehand
when
fischer
told
them
since
arthur
is
the
dreamer
all
he
needs
to
do
is
to
change
the
room
number(s)
how
does
one
wake
up
from
limbo?
edithistorydelete
most
importantly
the
person
needs
to
be
fully
aware
that
he's
in
limbo
under
heavy
sedation
and
with
the
time
machine
still
in
countdown
one
needs
to
produce
2
synchronized
kicks
to
return

needs
to
synchronize
the
kick
that
person
performs
in
limbo
with
all
kicks
on
the
level
above
to

1
dream
then
return
to
reality
under
normal
sedation
just
by
killing
themselves
or
performing
a
kick
on
each
level
would
do
(doesn't
need
to
be
synchronized
since
a
slight
disturbance
can
cause
dreams
to
collapse)
what
did
cobb
putting
a
spinning
top
inside
the
safe
mean?
edithistorydelete
the
safe
is
a
creation
of
the
subconscious
that
cobb
exploits
in
this
case
mal
the
safes
are
constructed
so
that
the
target
believes
that
it
is
a
safe
place
for
them
to
store
their
secrets
the
top
is
mal's
totem
which
she
uses
to
determine
whether
she's
in
a
dream
if
it
never
stops
spinning
it
tells
mal
that
she's
in
a
dream
by
placing
a
constantly
spinning
totem
in
the
safe
cobb
is
placing
a
very
simple
idea
(the
world
is
not
real)
inside
her
subconscious
it's
not
that
she
saw
the
totem
spinning
but
that
it
was
always
spinning
in
her
subconscious
mind
this
is
why
she
thought
she
was
trapped
in
the
dream
world
what
is
the
evidence
that
show
the
whole
film
is
a
dream?
edithistorydelete
the
evidence
is
generally
very
weak

characters
mal
and
saito
both
tell
cobb
to
take
a
leap
of
faith
and
cobb
predicts
what
saito
will
say
in
limbo
[however
coincidental
and
repeated
lines
are
common
in
countless
films
without
any
reason
to
believe
they
are
all
a
dream
additionally
the
term
take
a
leap
of
faith
would
be
basically
ubiquitous
in
a
world
where
one
must
actually
kill
themselves
just
to
wake
up
from
a
dream]
4
the
clumsiness
of
the
homicide
police
investigation
regarding
mal's
case
and
put
the
blame
on
cobb
entirely
[we
don't
know
all
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
investigation
and
bad
investigations
happen
all
the
time
so
this
is
hardly
evidence
for
the
whole
film
being
a
dream]
5
the
spinning
top
at
the
end
of
the
film
the
top
is
a
totem
used
to
help
verify
whether
cobb's
in
reality
or
in
someone
else's
dream
but
it
offers
no
verification
against
being
in
his
own
dream
he
knows
the
exact
weight
composition
and
how
it
should
spin
so
whether
the
top
stops
or
continue
spinning
it's
not
important
as
even
when
it
stops
it
could
be
that
cobb
believes
that
he
finally
reunite
with
his
family
hence
his
dream
fully
becomes
his
reality
[it's
true
that
if
the
whole
film
is
a
dream
the
top
wouldn't
matter
but
this
is
not
evidence
for
the
film
being
a
dream
you
could
say
that
about
any
behavior
of
any
object
in
the
whole
movie]
6
in
mombasa
in
the
bathroom
after
he
tests
yusuf's
sedative
you
see
the
figure
of
mal
behind
the
curtains
if
he
was
in
reality
then
his
subconscious
could
not
be
projecting
her
[not
projections
these
were
just
memories
the
curtains
were
not
in
yusuf's
bathroom

they
are
the
same
curtains
as
in
the
hotel
room]
7
cobb's
totem
was
not
mal's
top
rather
one
could
suggest
that
mal
was
his
reality
check
his
'real'
totem
yet
throughout
the
movie
he
was
directly
or
indirectly
responsible
for
either
killing
her
or
imprisoning
her
in
essence
losing
his
sense
of
reality
and
refusing
to
face
up
to
the
facts

which
may
be
that
he
was
indeed
dreaming
the
whole
time
[cobb's
totem
was
mal's
top
in
no
way
was
mal
his
reality
check

it
is
quite
the
opposite]
8
the
musical
score
that
is
heard
is
the
slowed
down
playhead
of
non
je
ne
regrette
rien
which
is
the
edith
piaf
song
used
for
the
musical
countdown
the
significance
here
is
that
the
deeper
you
go
into
the
dream
time
slows
thus
the
music
will
slow
too
mimicking
the
score
this
musical
design
perhaps
indicates
that
cobb's
reality
was
still
very
much
a
dream
state
too
[the
music
only
slows
down
when
listened
to
from
a
lower
level
due
to
the
time
dilation
at
that
level
yes
the
song
was
integrated
into
the
score
but
only
as
a
theme]
[how
do
you
know?
maybe
the
original
poster
is
right)
9
numerous
improbable
or
coincidental
events
that
happened
during
parts
of
reality
cobb
is
saved
by
saito
coincidentally
during
the
chase
between
cobol
engineering
agents
and
him
[saito
has
been
tailing
cobb
to
protect
his
investment

not
coincidental
at
all]
10
nearly
the
entire
team
is
highly
proficient
with
all
types
of
weaponry
though
certainly
cobb
at
least
does
not
appear
to
have
had
any
particularized
weapons
training
how
does
ariadne
know
how
to
even
fire
a
gun
much
less
hit
anything?
all
appear
to
be
highly
capable
in
all
sorts
of
militaristic
tasks
from
skiing
to
explosives
to
hand
to
hand
combat
to
sniping
[they
are
in
a
dream
world
during
all
scenes
involving
weapon
use
their
real
world
weapon
abilities
would
have
no
effect
here
like
eames
was
saying
on

'you
need
to
learn

then

over

the

in
the
sense
that
nolan
is
suggesting
that
what
we
think
of
as
a
waking
state
or
'reality'
is
in
fact
just
more
dreaming
(which
is
not
supported
by
any
interviews
with
nolan
or
statements
by
the
cast/crew
anywhere)
hinduism
and
buddhism
both
share
the
idea
that
the
world
is
'maya'
or
an
illusion
and
that
we
are
on
a
journey
of
'awakening
from
the
dream'
this
has
been
taught
by
such
indian
saints
as
sri
ramana
maharishi
and
maharishi
mahesh
yogi
who
call
it
'advaida'
which
means
nonduality
the
idea
that
all
the
universe
is
just
one
consciousness
connecting
everything
in
it
we
act
out
our
lives
like
a
play
shown
onto
a
movie
screen
but
only
those
who
achieve
nirvana
(aka
enlightenment
or
becoming
one
with
nature)
can
perceive
the
illusion
for
what
it
is
(a
dream)
and
become
aware
of
the
'screen'
on
which
the
great
drama
is
unfolding
according
to
the
advaida
philosophy
it
is
only
when
we
are
in
a
state
of
deep
sleep
that
we
come
close
to
the
timeless
'true'
state
of
being
that
is
the
universal
consciousness
which
all
nature
is
part
of
when
we
wake
up
in
effect
we
are
waking
into
a
world
that
is
illusory
a
separate
movement
believes
in
the
specific
idea
that
humanity
is
collectively
dreaming
a
dream
of
guilt
and
separation
from
which
we
need
to
wake
up
by
practising
forgiveness
this
is
a
metaphysic
ideology
given
in
a
course
in
miracles
and
the
way
of
mastery
which
are
spiritual
texts
purportedly
channelled
from
jesus
in
the
1970s
and
1990s
respectively
acim
in
particular
has
influenced
most
spiritual
'new
age'
authors
and
commentators
today
what
are
the
evidences
that
show
reality
exists
during
the
film
and
cobb
is
in
reality
at
the
end
of
the
film?

the
wedding
ring
on
cobb's
hand
that's
present
in
dreams
but
absent
in
the
real
world
[to
refute
this
could
be
because
in
what
cobb
sees
as
a
dream
he
wants
mal
to
still
be
alive
and
married
to
him
(keeps
her
alive
in
his
memories)
but
in
socalled
reality
cobb
knows
he's
not
married
anymore
and
took
it
off
it
may
in
fact
be
his
totem
so
if
cobb
took
it
off
long
ago
he
would
*not*
know
that
he
wasn't
in
reality
while
mourning
his
wife
i
doubt
he
would
consciously
check
the
weight
if
reality
is
*his*
dream
which
mal
says
in
an
argument
while
alive
his
subconscious
would
recreate
the
weight
anyway

cobb's
kids
phillipa

james
the
kids
at
the
end
of
the
film
are
different
and
are
older
compared
to
the
younger
ones
we've
seen
throughout
the
film
their
clothes
are
slightly
different
the
girl
has
a
white
shirt
underneath
her
red
dress
and
his
son
was
wearing
shoes
instead
of
sandals
at
the
end
this
is
the
most
solid
evidence
observe
carefully
also
if
he
was
dreaming
he
would
not
be
able
to
know
what
his
children's
faces
would
have
looked
like
turning
around
and
seeing
him
seeing
as
how
he
cannot
change
a
memory
he
even
said
himself
earlier
in
the
film
that
no
matter
how
hard
he
tried
he
can't
change
this
moment
he
will
never
see
his
children's
faces
unless
he
gets
back
to
them
[he
couldn't
change
the
moment
because
of
the
guilt
(which
he
has
now
freed
at
the
end
of
the
movie)
but
yes
the
clothes
and
actors
were
different
this
is
solid
evidence]
[but
he
did
change
his
memory
when
he
saw
him
and
mal
young
at
the
time
of
their
deaths
in
limbo
so
why
couldnt
he
change
this
memory?
and
if
they
were
invisioned
young
becasue
it
was
from
ariadne's
point
of
view
(as
explained
form
one
of
the
otehr
faq
questions)
and
she
only
knew
them
as
young
then
why
could
she
invision
them
as
old
at
the
end
of
the
film
when
she
didnt
know
what
they
looked
like
old?
couldnt
cobb
invision
his
children
as
older
knowing
that
they
were
older?]
3
the
top
there's
a
significant
difference
between
the
top
that
keeps
spinning
flawlessly
when
he's
in
a
dream
and
the
top
that's
spinning
at
the
end
of
the
film
(it
clearly
wobbles
loses
momentum
and
does
sound
like
it
is
stopping)
[it
does
wobble
and
lose
momentum
strong
signs
but
to
me
it
sounded
not
like
it
toppled
but
that
the
sound
for
the
top
cut
out
i
rewatched
the
movie
yesterday]
but
totems
tell
you
when
you
are
not
in
your
own
dream
so
maybe
it
stopped
spinning
because
it
is
his
dream
(?)
(no
it
only
tells
you
that
you
are
dreaming
it
has
no
specificity
to
who's
dream
it
is)
4
it
is
showed
at
the
end
that
cobb
and
mal
did
grow
old
together
for
50
years
in
limbo
with
them
walking
the
streets
as
old
man
and
woman
two
old
hands
hold
together
on
the

cobb
remembers
exactly
how
he
got
to
where
he
is
which
he
wouldn't
know
if
he
was
dreaming
[oh?
where
was
the
car
ride
from
the
airport
to
home?
did
he
even
think
to
try
to
remember?
not
that
i
believe
that
he
was
dreaming
but
it
isn't
explicitly
stated]
7
the
emotional
depth
of
the
film
if
the
ending
is
real
it
shows
that
cobb
does
go
on
an
emotional
journey
to
take
a
'leap
of
faith'
to
believe
that
saito
will
honor
their
agreement
so
he
could
go
home
and
see
his
kids
and
finally
get
over
with
his
wife's
death
and
guilt
the
scene
where
cobb
talks
with
old
saito
is
significant
as
it
shows
they've
grown
and
become
friends
as
cobb
had
said
to
him
come
back
and
let's
be
young
men
together
he's
'transformed'
because
of
his
leap
of
faith
and
he's
rewarded
by
finally
reuniting
with
his
kids
[this
is
hardly
evidence
to
support
it
was
reality
even
if
i
agree
that
it
was
the
important
part
to
the
ending
is
that
it
doesn't
actually
matter
if
the
top
fell
or
not
if
it's
reality
or
not
the
character
arc
you
are
talking
about
could
have
happened
with
or
without
reality
and
in
the
end
cobb
gets
what
he
wants/needs
that
is
the
resolution]
8
cobb
and
mal
do
not
end
up
together
this
could
only
be
a
factor
of
reality
if
it
were
a
dream
cobb
would
have
found
a
way
of
keeping
mal
alive
in
the
dream
so
that
he
could
be
with
her
[*very*
solid
evidence]
(cobb
wouldn't
want
to
do
this
because
he
states
that
his
recreation
of
her
in
his
dreams
isn't
good
enough
because
it
doesn't
truly
capture
what
she
was
in
real
life
with
all
her
perfection
and
flaws)
9
throughout
the
shooting
script
nolan
uses
the
simple
transitional
element
for
changing
scenes
and
we
cut
to
every
time
this
occurs
it's
not
cutting
to
another
scene
with
in
the
'present'
reality
but
it
'cuts
to'
either
a
higher
or
lower
dream
within
the
dream
or
it
'cuts
to'
reality
so
at
the
end
of
the
shooting
script
nolan
writes
and
we
fade
out
by
nolan
saying
that
it
doesn't
'cut
to'
another
level
of
the
dream
or
back
to
reality
but
instead
it
simply
'fades
out'
nolan
is
letting
us
the
viewer
know
that
after
reality
there
is
nothing
to
'cut
to'
so
cobb
is
presently
in
reality
nolan
allows
the
viewer
to
make
his/her
own
assumptions
based
upon
their
optimistic/pessimistic
worldview
but
nolan's
in
one
of
optimism
as
can
be
seen
in
all
his
other
films
he's
not
a
'happy
ending'
director
but
he's
optimistic
about
the
future
[all
scripts
start
with
fade
in
and
end
with
fade
out]
10
a
second
after
'inception'
appears
on
the
end
credits
you
can
begin
hearing
the
top
lose
momentum
in
its
spin
(it
sounds
almost
like
it's
sliding
along
the
table)
now
that
the
film
is
out
on
bluray
and
dvd
i
imagine
that
more
people
will
notice
this
keep
in
mind
there
is
music
playing
during
the
credits
so
you
do
have
to
listen
for
it
but
it
the
sound
is
there
i'm
100%
sure
i
kept
an
ear
out
for
this
after
dileep
rao
said
to
use
your
ears
not
your
eyes
to
figure
out
if
the
top
fell
or
not
well
using
your
ears
you
will
hear
it
losing
momentum
until
it
comes
to
a
stop
if
anybody
has
any
other
interpretation
as
to
what
this
means
i'm
interested
in
hearing
it
[see
annotation
for
number
3]
alternatively
nolan
is
showing
that
what
we
commonly
believe
to
be
reality
exists
during
the
film
and
that
cobb
is
indeed
in
what
we'd
call
'reality'
at
the
end
of
the
film
but
the
spinning
top
is
a
clue
from
him

an
inception
to
us
the
audience

that
our
idea
of
'reality'
may
in
itself
be
the
projection
of
a
dreaming
mind
that
collectively
we
are
all
dreaming
an
outpictured
'reality'
full
of
projected
figures
for
more
on
this
idea
and
its
spiritual
origins
and
reasoning
see
the
previous
faq
(and
others)
what
is
the
music
used
in
the
trailers?
edithistorydelete
in
the
teaser
trailer
the
music
used
is
a
custom
score
from
sencit
music
composed
by
mike
zarin
(website
here)
the
second
trailer
uses
a
variation
of
the
same
song
the
longer
theatrical
trailer
uses
a
track
titled
mind
heist
composed
by
zack
hemsey
(website
here)
contrary
to
popular
belief
the
music
was
not
composed
by
hans
zimmer
who
composed
the
actual
score
for
the
film
does
cobb
ever
wake
up?
edithistorydelete
the
evidence
strongly
suggests
that
he
did
multiple
cast
members
who
worked
with
christopher
nolan
directly
and
heard
his
whole
vision
of
the
movie
probably
ad
nauseum
including
michael
caine
explicitly
and
dileep
rao
implicitly
confirm
that
the
ending
is
part
of
reality
the
top
is
heard
strongly
wobbling
about
to
tip
as
the
screen
cuts
to
black
upon
the
completion
of
a
successful
mission
with
the
team
one
could
either
believe
that
cobb
was
able
to
save
saito
and
himself
from
limbo
reuniting
him
with
his
family
in
reality
or
we
can
believe
that
he
was
stuck
forever
and
ever
more
in
his
limbo
and
had
only
imagined
him
saving
saito
and
reuniting
with
his
family
the
latter
theory
however
does
not
match
with
any
characteristics
of
limbo
presented
in
the
movie
in
order
for
the
final
scenes
with
cobb
to
be
limbo
he
(who
knows
that
limbo
is
not
real)
would
have
to
build
an
airplane

ages

two
years
apart)

are
multiple
memories
some
of
which
show
the
younger

playing
at

beach
others
show
the
younger
children
playing
in

throughout
the
film
the
younger
children
also
appear
run
around
a
corner
leading
cobb
to
mal
in
the
final

certainly
the
children
appear
to
be

similar
age

to
be
wearing
similar
clothing
repeat
analysis
shows
that
the
clothing
is
similar
at
the
end
though
not
the

the
children
do
look
older
however
considering
the
power
of
the
dreamer
to
alter
the
world
of
the
dream
this
is
no
guarantee
that
the
children
if
indeed
they
are
projections
haven't
just
been
changed
by
cobb
so
that
he
will
accept
them
as
real
certainly
the
story
is
very
clever
in
creating
this
ambiguity
cobb
is
unable
to
see
their
faces
in
his
memory
of
the
yard
to
confirm
they
look
younger
(the
body
shows
they
are
smaller)
other
theories
have
suggested
that
the
reason
for

to
have

set
visible

since
fischer
has
been
told
that
he

he

did

edithistorydelete
cobb

also
even

ariadne
asks

whose

we
going
into?
but
once
you
know
what
to
look
or
more
importantly
to
listen
for
the
clues
are
all
there
the
opening
sequence
is
arthur's
dream
(the
villa)
inside
nash's
dream
(the
apartment)
the
training
exercises
follow
a
similar
pattern
first
the
teacher
(cobb
in
the
cafe
arthur
on
the
penrose
staircase)
then
ariadne
in
her
own
version
of
the
same
environment
the
main
mission
is
eames'
dream
(the
snow
fort)
inside
arthur's
dream
(the
hotel)
inside
yusuf's
dream
(the
city)
limbo
is
apparently
limbo
it
doesn't
belong
to
anyone
although
cobb
can
claim
squatters'
rights
one
relatively
easy
way
of
keeping
it
straight
is
that
the
person
whose
dream
it
is
stays
behind
in
order
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
place
yusuf
drives
the
van
arthur
fights
the
guard
in
the
hotel
eames
sets
the
explosive
charges
is
this
simply
a
matter
of
convenience
or
are
dreams
limited
to
one
apiece?
can
you
fall
asleep
in
your
own
dream?
it
would
seem
so
because
cobb
and
mal
went
down
several
levels
presumably
on
their
own
how
did
cobb
and
saito
end
up
in
the
same
limbo?
why
not
each
their
own?
edithistorydelete
limbo
is
unconstructed
(ie
not
preconstructed
by
an
architect)
dream
space
it
like
all
levels
of
subconsciousness
when
hooked
up
to
the
machine
is
a
shared
environment
between
the
dreamers
the
only
thing
there
is
anything
created
by
a
dreamer
that
has
been
down
there
before
and
is
sharing
the
dream
with
you
cobb
and
saito
share
the
dreams
all
the
way
until
level
3
when
cobb
goes
down
to
limbo
but
saito
doesn't
then
saito
dies
and
heads
to

cobb

entered
limbo
through
the
machine
(not
via
death)
now
dies
(either
in
the
hospital
elevator
van
or
all
three
it
doesn't
really
matter)
since
saito
died
before
cobb
in
level
3
many
years
have
gone
by
for
him
accounting
for
his
age
the
passage
of

is
unpredictable

nice

the
other

what
is
the
significance
of
the
penrose
stairs
in
relation
to
the
structure
and
meaning
of
the
movie?
edithistorydelete
the
concept
of
the
infinite
staircase
(penrose
stairs)
is
used
as
a
blueprint
for
the
structure
and
form
of
the
film
and
ultimately
for
its
meaning
the
fact
that
no
definite
conclusion
can
be
given
as
to
whether
it's
reality
or
a
dream
points
that
the
entire
movie
is
designed
as
one
infinite
staircase
where
the
levels
of
the
dream
and
reality
are
an
analogy
for
the
stairs
in
the
infinite
staircase
the
penrose
stairs
being
an
impossible
structure
this
movie
presents
us
with
an
impossible
concept/dilemma
that
the
movie
can
be
either
reality
or
dream
depending
on
how
you
look
at
the
arguments
it's
similar
to
circling
the
penrose
stairs
in
a
clockwise
or
counterclockwise
direction
that
determines
whether
you
are
ascending
or
descending
the
last
kick
we
see
(the
van
falling
off
the
edge)
wakes
everyone
but
cobb
and
saito
up
(who
are
in
limbo)
but
then
they're
all
seen
breathing
in
the
van
for
a
while
how
did
they
suddenly
get
back
to
the
plane?
edithistorydelete
possibility
#1
although
some
may
believe
that
the
air
hostess
simply
knocking
each
passenger
off
their
seat
would
wake
them
others
suggest
it's
more
likely
that
the
pilots
dipped
the
plane
momentarily
(given
saito
owned
the
airline)
it
is
unlikely
however
that
the
air
hostess
or
pilots
could
have
been
prepared
to
apply
a
kick
as
a
they
didn't
provide
a
musical
countdown
b
eames
suggests
that
the
original
time
scale
of
the
plan
was
a
lot
slower
with
him
having
the
whole
night
to
crack
fischer
since
they
didn't
know
in
advance
that
fischer's
mind
would
be
militarised
why
would
they
have
needed
to
plan
a
kick?
possibility
#2
yusuf
had
designed
the
sedatives
to
wear
off
after
a
specific
amount
of
time
and
they
simply
killed
themselves
to
wake
up
this
doesn't
really
make
sense
because
the
sedative
would
have
to
be
in
effect
for
the
whole
dream
otherwise
cobb
couldn't
have
confidently
stated
they
had
a
week
of
dream
time
it
is
possible
however
that
yusuf
had
an
antidote
he
had
given
to
the
air
hostess
to
administer
at
a
specific
time
possibility
#3
they
waited
around
for
another
6
days
till
they
simply
awoke
from
the
dream
this
is
highly
unlikely
given
how
militarised
fischer's
subconscious
was!
this
is
the
most
likely
possibility
but
is
a
little
far
fetched
considering
how
satio
didn't
even
survive
a
few
hours
in
that
militarised
environment
without
getting
shot
possibility
#3b
they
waited
around
another
6
days
till
they
awoke
from
the
dream
sure
fischer's
subconscious
was
militarized
however
they
don't
attack
until
fischer
gets
kidnapped
so
one
could
assume
that
once
the
van
hits
the
water
the
others
wait
underneath
in
order
to
avoid
being
seen
by
fischer
so
fischer
assumes
he
is
now
safe
and
in
the
real
world
so
his
subconscious
would
then
back
off
and
be
easier
to
evade
possibility
#4
since
the
ending
of
the
film
is
ambiguous
the
whole
ending
with
them
waking
up
on
the
plane
might
not
be
reality
and
therefore
is
not
proof
that
the
rest
of
the
crew
made
it
out
of
the
first
level
of
the
dream
if
we
are
never
shown
eames
yusuf
ariadne
and
fischer
waking
on
the
plane
in
reality
then
for
all
we
know
they're
still
hanging
out
in
level
one
impossibility
some
suggest
that
because
yusuf
isn't
shown
on
camera
after
the
van
plunges
into
the
water
it's
possible
he
was
kicked
out
of
the
dream
and
was
awoken
because
he
was
conscious
when
the
rest
in
the
van
weren't
he
then
turned
off
the
dream
machine/woke
them
up
in
reality
this
isn't
possible
for
several
reasons
firstly
because
as
we
see
with
arthur
when
the
van
drives
off
the
edge
he
didn't
get
kicked
out
of
the
dream!
we
assume
this
is
because
they
all
have
to
come
out
of
the
dream
at
once
secondly
the
city
where
the
van
falls
off
the
bridge
is
in
yusuf's
mind
so
if
he
woke
up
surely
everyone
would
be
thrust
into
limbo?
how
come
when
the
van
drives
off
the
bridge
in
level
one
the
dream
is
in
zero
gravity
in
level
two
but
the
dream
in
level
three
has
perfectly
normal
gravity?
edithistorydelete
firstly
we
know
that
the
effects
of
one
level
have
stronger
effects
on
their
proceeding
level
than
any
after
that
which
is
why
saito
feels
less
pain
from
his
gunshot
wounds
as
he
gets
deeper
level
three
is
therefore
less
likely
to
feel
the
effects
of
level
one
secondly
the
dreamers
in
level
one
(specifically
arthur
because
level
two
is
arthur's
dream)
are
feeling
a
zerogravity
drop
which
causes
level
two
to
lose
gravity
however
the
dreamers
in
level
two
(specifically
eames
because
level
three
is
his
dream)
aren't
feeling
zerogravity
they're
experiencing
a
lack
of
gravity
it's
the
movement
that
affects
the
dreamer
not
the
experience
and
thus
because
the
dreamers
probably
can't
feel
this
weightlessness
when
they're
asleep
it
won't
affect
their
dream
how
is
the
dream
machine
brought
to
deeper
dream
levels?
edithistorydelete
the
dream
machine
could
be
planted
by
the
dreamers
in
each
level
the
device
itself
does
not
need
to
be
duplicated

it
could
exist
as
an
idea
or
projection
in
the
dream
for
example
the
dreamers
probably
do
not
understand
the
exact
physics
of
their
weapons
but
they
have
an
innate
understanding
and
conviction
of
their
effects
(bullet
piercing
injury
pain
etc)
with
training
and
experience
a
dreamer
could
develop
a
likewise
understanding
of
the
dream
machine's
properties
in
order
for
their
subconscious
to
manage
it
while
inside
the
dream
in
order
to
be
woken
up
from
a
dream
you
have
to
be
kicked
from
the
level
above
so
how
does
ariadne
kick
herself
out
of
limbo?
edithistorydelete
she
knows
she's
in
limbo
and
she
throws
herself
off
the
tall
balcony
(after
fischer)
she
either
dies
on
impact
or
dies
in
mid
air
bringing
her
back
up
to
level
3
(albeit
only
momentarily
while
the
snow
fortress
is
crumbling)
why
did
ariadne
go
to
the
levels
above
when
she
killed
herself
while
in
limbo
instead
of
waking
up
completely
like
cobb
did?
edithistorydelete
when
ariadne
killed
herself
the
higher
levels
of
the
dream
still
existed
when
cobb
presumably
killed
himself
however
the
higher
levels
had
already
collapsed
so
the
only
place
cobb
could
go
when
he
escaped
limbo
was
reality
how
much
time
was
on
the
second
level
when
saito
was
being
extracted?
it
says
that
it's
different
with
heavy
sedation

the
movie
doesn't
say
how

so
we
don't
know

how

when
they're

is
it
possible
that
fischer's
father
did
in
fact
want
him
to
be
his
own
man
and
split
up
the
company
but
never
got
the
chance
to
tell
him
before
he
died?
edithistorydelete
that
may
seem
to
be
what
cobb
saito
and
the
rest
of
the
team
want
fischer
to
believe
but
it
seems
as
though
the
sequencing
of
the
mission
with
what
specifically
revolves
around
the
aspects
that
fischer
experiences
supports
it
too
with
cobb
and
his
team
having
exposed
deception
that
browning
had
employed
at
one
point
this
leads
them
to
follow
the
possibility
that
fischer's
father
wanted
what
was
best
for
his
son
and
therefore
allow
him
to
trust
his
own
judgment
when
it
came
to
anything
involving
such
thus
browning
attempted
to
have
fischer
continue
running
the
company
the
way
his
father
did
so
it
would
benefit
him
while
fischer's
father
who
had
not
realized
how
much
he
had
neglected
his
son
until
the
end
of
his
life
had
actually
desired
better
for
him
fischer
himself
believes
in
the
idea
of
doing
right
in
his
own
life
per
his
father's
wishes
by
deciding
to
break
up
the
company
which
is
not
only
what
cobb
saito
and
the
team
sought
to
happen
in
the
end
but
rather
what
fischer
was
destined
to
do
to
begin
with
therefore
the
mission
actually
doesn't
just
benefit
saito's
own
ambitions
but
corrects
a
karmic
injustice
too
