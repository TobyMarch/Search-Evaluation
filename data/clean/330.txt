holden
caulfield
writes
his
story
from
a
rest
home
to
which
he
has
been
sent
for
therapy
he
refuses
to
talk
about
his
early
life
mentioning
only
that
his
brother
d
b
is
a
hollywood
writer
he
hints
that
he
is
bitter
because
d
b
has
sold
out
to
hollywood
forsaking
a
career
in
serious
literature
for
the
wealth
and
fame
of
the
movies
he
then
begins
to
tell
the
story
of
his
breakdown
beginning
with
his
departure
from
pencey
prep
a
famous
school
he
attended
in
agerstown
pennsylvania
holden’s
career
at
pencey
prep
has
been
marred
by
his
refusal
to
apply
himself
and
after
failing
four
of
his
five
subjects—he
passed
only
english—he
has
been
forbidden
to
return
to
the
school
after
the
fall
term
the
saturday
before
christmas
vacation
begins
holden
stands
on
thomsen
hill
overlooking
the
football
field
where
pencey
plays
its
annual
grudge
match
against
saxon
hall
holden
has
no
interest
in
the
game
and
hadn’t
planned
to
watch
it
at
all
he
is
the
manager
of
the
school’s
fencing
team
and
is
supposed
to
be
in
new
york
for
a
meet
but
he
lost
the
team’s
equipment
on
the
subway
forcing
everyone
to
return
early
holden
is
full
of
contempt
for
the
prep
school
but
he
looks
for
a
way
to
“say
goodbye”
to
it
he
fondly
remembers
throwing
a
football
with
friends
even
after
it
grew
dark
outside
holden
walks
away
from
the
game
to
go
say
goodbye
to
mr
spencer
a
former
history
teacher
who
is
very
old
and
ill
with
the
flu
he
sprints
to
spencer’s
house
but
since
he
is
a
heavy
smoker
he
has
to
stop
to
catch
his
breath
at
the
main
gate
at
the
door
spencer’s
wife
greets
holden
warmly
and
he
goes
in
to
see
his
teacher
summary
chapter
2
“life
is
a
game
boy
life
is
a
game
that
one
plays
according
to
the
rules”
(see
important
quotations
explained)
holden
greets
mr
spencer
and
his
wife
in
a
manner
that
suggests
he
is
close
to
them
he
is
put
off
by
his
teacher’s
rather
decrepit
condition
but
seems
otherwise
to
respect
him
in
his
sickroom
spencer
tries
to
lecture
holden
about
his
academic
failures
he
confirms
pencey’s
headmaster’s
assertion
that
“[l]ife
is
a
game”
and
tells
holden
that
he
must
learn
to
play
by
the
rules
although
spencer
clearly
feels
affection
for
holden
he
bluntly
reminds
the
boy
that
he
flunked
him
and
even
forces
him
to
listen
to
the
terrible
essay
he
handed
in
about
the
ancient
egyptians
finally
spencer
tries
to
convince
holden
to
think
about
his
future
not
wanting
to
be
lectured
holden
interrupts
spencer
and
leaves
returning
to
his
dorm
room
before
dinner
analysis
chapters
1–2
holden
caulfield
is
the
protagonist
of
the
catcher
in
the
rye
and
the
most
important
function
of
these
early
chapters
is
to
establish
the
basics
of
his
personality
from
the
beginning
of
the
novel
holden
tells
his
story
in
a
bitterly
cynical
voice
he
refuses
to
discuss
his
early
life
he
says
because
he
is
bored
by
“all
that
david
copperfield
kind
of
crap”
he
gives
us
a
hint
that
something
catastrophic
has
happened
in
his
life
acknowledging
that
he
writes
from
a
rest
home
to
tell
about
“this
madman
stuff”
that
happened
to
him
around
the
previous
christmas
but
he
doesn’t
yet
go
into
specifics
the
particularities
of
his
story
are
in
keeping
with
his
cynicism
and
his
boredom
he
has
failed
out
of
school
and
he
leaves
spencer’s
house
abruptly
because
he
does
not
enjoy
being
confronted
by
his
actions
beneath
the
surface
of
holden’s
tone
and
behavior
runs
a
more
idealistic
emotional
current
he
begins
the
story
of
his
last
day
at
pencey
prep
by
telling
how
he
stood
at
the
top
of
thomsen
hill
preparing
to
leave
the
school
and
trying
to
feel
“some
kind
of
a
goodby”
he
visits
spencer
in
chapter
2
even
though
he
failed
spencer’s
history
class
and
he
seems
to
respond
to
mrs
spencer’s
kindness
what
bothers
him
the
most
in
these
chapters
and
throughout
the
book
is
the
hypocrisy
and
ugliness
around
him
which
diminish
the
innocence
and
beauty
of
the
external
world—the
unpleasantness
of
spencer’s
sickroom
for
instance
and
his
hairless
legs
sticking
out
of
his
pajamas
salinger
thus
treats
his
narrator
as
more
than
a
mere
portrait
of
a
cynical
postwar
rich
kid
at
an
impersonal
and
pressurefilled
boarding
school
even
in
these
early
chapters
holden
connects
with
life
on
a
very
idealistic
level
he
seems
to
feel
its
flaws
so
deeply
that
he
tries
to
shield
himself
with
a
veneer
of
cynicism
the
catcher
in
the
rye
is
in
many
ways
a
book
about
the
betrayal
of
innocence
by
the
modern
world
despite
his
bitter
tone
holden
is
an
innocent
searching
desperately
for
a
way
to
connect
with
the
world
around
him
that
will
not
cause
him
pain
in
these
early
chapters
the
reader
already
begins
to
sense
that
holden
is
not
an
entirely
reliable
narrator
and
that
the
reality
of
his
situation
is
somehow
different
from
the
way
he
describes
it
in
part
this
is
simply
because
holden
is
a
firstperson
narrator
describing
his
own
experiences
from
his
own
point
of
view
any
individual’s
point
of
view
in
any
novel
or
story
is
necessarily
limited
the
reader
never
forgets
for
a
moment
who
is
telling
this
story
because
the
tone
grammar
and
diction
are
consistently
those
of
an
adolescent—albeit
a
highly
intelligent
and
expressive
one—and
every
event
receives
holden’s
distinctive
commentary
however
holden’s
narrative
contains
inconsistencies
that
make
us
question
what
he
says
for
instance
holden
characterizes
spencer’s
behavior
throughout
as
vindictive
and
meanspirited
but
spencer’s
actions
clearly
seem
to
be
motivated
by
concern
for
holden’s
wellbeing
holden
seems
to
be
looking
for
reasons
not
to
listen
to
spencer

rye

'the
song
“comin’
thro’
the
rye”
asks
if
it
is
wrong
for
two
people
to
have
a
romantic
encounter
out
in
the
fields
away
from
the
public
eye
even
if
they
don’t
plan
to
have
a
commitment
to
one
another'
i
thought
the
'rye'
referred
to
in
robert
burns'
poem
was
the
river
rye
hence
the
lines
'jenny's
a
wet
poor
body
jenny's
seldom
dry'
in
this
regard
it
is
about
two
people
who
meet
at
a
river
with
no
crossing
which
will
cause
people
to
question
why
one
of
them
is
wet
and
what
they
have

i
have

one
very
important
quotation
from
this
novel
to
have
been
left
out
on
this
page
it
is
very
useful
for
many
papers
and
is
a
very
important
quotation!
chapter
25
(towards
the
end)
the
thing
with
kids
is
if
they
want
to
grab
for
the
gold
ring
you
have
to
let
them
do
it
and
not
say
anything
if
they
fall
off
they
fall
off
but
it's
bad
if
you
say
anything
to
them
this
occurs
while
holden
is
watching
phoebe
ride
the
carousel
in
central
park
and
fears
phoebe
will
