the
catcher
in
the
rye
in
a
nutshell
the
catcher
in
the
rye
a
novel
narrated
by
main
character
and
hero
holden
caulfield
is
the
story
of
holden's
life
in
the
few
days
after
being
expelled
from
his
pennsylvania
prep
school
published
in
1951
by
jd
salinger
the
catcher
in
the
rye
has
been
banned
more
times
than
you
want
to
count
by
zealous
parents
and
educators
not
that
anybody's
surprised
by
this
(because
of
the
profanity
sex
alcohol
abuse
prostitution
–
need
we
go
on?)
but
interestingly
it's
also
frequently
used
as
part
of
high
school
english
classes
with
more
than
60
million
copies
sold
to
date
it's
one
of
the
world's
top
sellers
(accordingly
it's
been
translated
into
many
languages
including
russian
spanish
german
and
japanese)
the
catcher
in
the
rye
is
close
to
jd
salinger's
heart
he
has
never
allowed
it
to
be
produced
as
a
film
a
lot
of
mystery
and
controversy
surrounds
jd
salinger
it
seems
he
stopped
publishing
his
work
just
when
he
was
peaking
as
an
author
and
since
then
has
been
essentially
a
social
recluse
granting
no
interviews
and
making
no
public
appearances
whatsoever
some
people
think
he's
sort
of
a
holden
caulfield
himself
the
catcher
in
the
rye
ended
up
as
an
emblem
of
counterculture
in
the
1950s
and
60s
–
a
symbol
of
alienation
and
isolation
for
the
disillusioned
and
restless
postwar
generation
salinger's
own
isolation
from
society
only
amplifies
the
mystery
and
allure
of
this
important
book
&nbsp
why
should
i
care?
moralizing
adults
who
hate
the
catcher
in
the
rye
write
holden
off
as
a
foulmouthed
misanthrope
he
flunks
out
of
school
picks
up
a
hooker
borrows
money
from
his
kid
sister
to
spend
on
booze
and
ends
up
in
a
mental
hospital
with
such
a
perverse
plot
they
insist
it’s
no
wonder
mark
david
chapman
blamed
his
obsession
with
the
book
for
making
him
shoot
and
kill
john
lennon
however
teens
who
hate
catcher
usually
tell
a
different
story
holden
is
a
boring
whiny
hypocrite
who
despises
his
life
but
makes
zero
effort
to
change
it
he’s
in
love
with
a
girl
nothing
happens
he
goes
to
the
big
apple
nothing
happens
he
hires
a
prostitute
nothing
happens
all
that
scandal
the
censors
were
promising?
it
never
happens
both
sides
of
the
argument
hold
water
but
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
of
it
the
teenage
perspective
probably
hits
a
lot
closer
to
home
catcher
is
never
really
about
the
plot
it’s
about
holden
attempting
to
talk
you
through
his
inner
demons
holden
obsesses
over
the
loss
of
innocence
heroworships
his
kid
siblings
struggles
to
connect
with
anyone
his
own
age
and
thinks
all
adults
are
selfimportant
phonies
for
a
guy
who
wishes
he
could
pull
a
peter
pan
on
his
biological
clock
having
no
forward
momentum
in
the
narrative
is
kind
of
the
point
which
means
that
if
you’re
not
interested
in
holden
or
his
struggle
the
book
won’t
exactly
have
a
lot
of
entertainment
value
for
you
you’d
think
that
the
facebook
/
myspace
/
twitter
/
reality
tv
generation
would
be
more
receptive
to
the
ramblings
of
a
confused
17yearold
but
many
of
today’s
readers
seem
less
impressed
with
the
catcher
in
the
rye
than
ever
so
tell
us
shmooparinos
is
holden
getting
harder
to
relate
to?
have
our
attention
spans
been
ruined
by
incessant
texting
and
a
140character
limit?
are
we
so
caught
up
in
telling
our
own
stories
nowadays
that
we’ve
forgotten
how
to
listen
to
anyone
else’s?
