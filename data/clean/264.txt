is
the
year
1775
and
england
and
france
are
undergoing
a
period
of
social
upheaval
and
turmoil
the
forces
that
are
leading
to
revolution
in
france
are
colliding
with
a
circle
of
people
in
england
causing
their
destinies
to
be
irrevocably
intertwined
lucie
manette
a
young
woman
who
has
been
raised
as
an
orphan
and
a
ward
of
tellson's
bank
learns
that
her
father
is
alive
and
has
recently
been
released
from
prison
after
eighteen
years
of
unjust
incarceration
she
travels
to
the
french
suburb
of
saint
antoine
with
mr
jarvis
lorry
a
longtime
tellson's
employee
who
had
managed
her
father's
affairs
before
his
imprisonment
they
find
her
father
at
the
home
of
ernest
defarge
a
former
domestic
of
dr
manette's
who
has
housed
the
doctor
since
his
release
though
her
father
is
teetering
on
the
brink
of
insanity
she
solemnly
vows
that
she
will
be
true
to
him
and
devote
her
life
to
helping
him
recover
himself
the
family
relocates
to
london
and
mr
lorry
becomes
a
friend
of
the
family
after
time
the
doctor
begins
to
recover
and
resumes
his
practice
and
though
he
occasionally
reverts
back
to
his
trancelike
state
he
slowly
but
surely
returns
to
himself
throughout
the
process
he
and
lucie
become
extremely
close
after
a
period
of
five
years
lucie
and
her
father
are
called
to
testify
in
the
trial
of
charles
darnay
a
french
citizen
and
london
resident
who
has
been
accused
of
treason
against
england
lucie
testifies
that
she
and
her
father
saw
darnay
on
a
ship
bound
for
england
the
night
she
brought
her
father
back
home
to
london
and
that
he
was
conversing
with
other
men
and
poring
over
documents
though
the
testimony
is
damaging
lucie
notes
that
darnay
had
been
extremely
kind
and
helpful
to
her
in
caring
for
her
father
on
the
ship
and
she
admits
that
she
hopes
her
testimony
has
not
doomed
him
darnay
is
ultimately
saved
when
one
witness'
testimony
hinges
on
the
witness'
certainty
that
he
saw
darnay
at
a
certain
locale
at
a
particular
time
when
sydney
carton
a
member
of
darnay's
defense
team
removes
his
wig
in
court
it
is
revealed
that
he
bears
a
striking
resemblance
to
darnay
thereby
eroding
the
witness'
credibility
in
terms
of
his
certainty
of
having
seen
charles
darnay
himself
darnay
is
ultimately
freed
and
this
circumstance
draws
everyone
involved
closer
together
darnay
along
with
mr
lorry
becomes
a
friend
of
the
family
and
sydney
carton
becomes
a
regular
visitor
if
not
an
entirely
welcome
onehe
is
frequently
drunk
often
sullen
and
coarse
in
his
manner
though
the
others
complain
of
carton's
manner
one
evening
he
confides
in
lucie
and
tells
her
that
while
he
has
made
nothing
of
his
life
and
will
not
improve
before
he
dies
he
wants
her
to
know
that
she
has
awakened
feelings
in
him
that
he
thought
had
been
stamped
out
long
ago
she
asks
if
she
can
help
him
and
he
says
no
but
that
he
wants
her
to
know
that
he
cares
for
her
deeply
the
group
continues
to
visit
regularly
and
on
one
particular
evening
lucie
notes
that
there
is
an
ominous
feeling
in
the
air
as
if
she
is
able
to
forecast
that
grave
danger
and
turmoil
are
in
her
future
but
the
family
continues
to
be
happy
and
lucie
eventually
marries
darnay
who
tells
her
father
that
he
has
a
secret
that
no
one
else
knows
dr
manette
asks
darnay
to
save
the
secret
for
the
marriage
morning
and
darnay
does
a
year
passes
darnay
returns
to
france
to
attend
to
the
business
that
had
gotten
him
into
trouble
in
england
in
the
first
place
he
pays
a
visit
to
his
uncle
a
corrupt
aristocrat
who
is
so
cruel
that
when
his
carriage
driver
recklessly
ran
over
and
killed
a
peasant's
child
he
blamed
the
peasants
for
being
in
the
way
after
having
dinner
in
his
uncle's
lavish
chateau
darnay
wakes
up
to
find
that
his
uncle
has
been
murdered
he
returns
to
england
and
several
more
years
pass
he
and
lucie
have
two
children
a
son
and
a
daughter
the
son
passes
away
as
a
young
boy
but
the
family
continues
to
be
relatively
happy
despite
this
tragic
circumstance
but
the
foreboding
sense
looms
in
the
air
and
mr
lorry
notes
that
many
of
tellson's
paris
customers
are
frantically
transferring
their
assets
to
the
london
branch
signaling
some
kind
of
danger
in
paris
he
notes
that
he
will
have
to
travel
to
paris
to
help
the
office
there
handle
the
volume
one
day
mr
lorry
remarks
to
darnay
that
he
has
received
a
letter
addressed
to
a
marquis
st
evr&eacutemonde
in
care
of
tellson's
darnay
says
that
he
knows
the
man
and
will
deliver
the
letter
in
truth
darnay
is
the
marquis
st
evr&eacutemonde
a
descendant
of
the
corrupt
rulers
of
france
the
letter
is
from
an
old
friend
who
has
been
put
in
prison
unjustly
and
who
fears
that
he
will
soon
be
executed
darnay
who
has
so
long
avoided
france
for
fear
of
what
might
happen
to
him
there
because
of
his
heritage
realizes
that
he
must
go
he
goes
to
intervene
on
his
friend's
behalf
and
quickly
realizes
that
the
situation
is
worse
than
he
could
have
imagined
a
revolution
has
taken
place
the
peasants
have
overthrown
the
government
and
are
murdering
anyone
who
they
feel
represents
the
old
guard
darnay
is
immediately
taken
into
custody
though
he
tries
desperately
to
explain
that
unlike
his
uncle
and
father
he
is
on
the
peasants'
side
and
wants
to
help
them
they
disregard
his
testimony
and
none
other
than
ernest
defarge
who
has
since
become
a
revolutionary
sends
darnay
to
prison
by
this
time
lucie
and
her
father
have
learned
that
darnay
has
returned
to
france
aware
that
darnay
is
probably
in
grave
danger
the
revolutionaries
treat
dr
manette
as
a
hero
however
because
he
had
so
long
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
same
government
that
oppressed
them
(and
that
they
have
since
overthrown)
because
of
his
newfound
influence
he
is
able
to
learn
where
darnay
is
and
he
intervenes
on
his
behalf
when
darnay
is
tried
for
his
life
in
front
of
a
corrupt
and
farcical
tribunal
only
dr
manette's
testimony
saves
him
he
is
freed
but
before
even
one
day
passes
he
is
recaptured
on
the
grounds
that
three
french
citizens
have
denounced
him
he
is
forced
to
undergo
another
trial
at
which
it
is
learned
that
the
citizens
who
denounced
him
are
ernest
defarge
madame
defarge
(ernest's
cruel
and
vengeful
wife)
and
dr
manette
when
dr
manette
declares
that
he
has
never
denounced
charles
and
that
whoever
accused
him
of
doing
so
is
lying
defarge
presents
a
paper
to
the
tribunal
to
be
read
aloud
the
paper
turns
out
to
be
a
journal
that
dr
manette
had
written
after
ten
years
in
prison
and
hidden
in
a
chimney
defarge
discovered
it
when
the
peasants
freed
that
particular
prison
the
account
reveals
that
dr
manette
had
learned
that
a
marquis
st
evr&eacutemonde
and
his
brother
had
cruelly
murdered
a
peasant
and
he
learned
this
because
the
men
retrieved
him
to
give
medical
attention
to
their
victims
before
they
died
he
saw
how
the
brothers
treated
their
victims
so
cruelly
and
he
had
written
a
letter
to
the
government
informing
them
of
what
he
saw
the
brothers
evr&eacutemonde
learned
that
dr
manette
had
written
the
letter
shortly
thereafter
he
was
taken
prisoner
and
his
wife
was
never
informed
of
what
happened
to
him
for
this
dr
manette
wrote
that
he
denounced
the
brothers
evr&eacutemonde
and
all
their
descendants
after
the
letter
is
read
the
court
erupts
into
an
uproar
and
the
tribunal
votes
unanimously
to
execute
darnay
lucie
and
her
father
are
beside
themselves
by
this
time
carton
has
traveled
to
paris
and
he
and
mr
lorry
confer
and
try
to
decide
what
to
do
during
this
time
dr
manette
tries
to
save
darnay
but
he
relapses
into
his
trancelike
state
and
is
unable
to
do
anything
through
a
series
of
coincidences
carton
discovers
that
one
of
the
men
who
testified
against
darnay
at
his
trial
several
years
earlier
is
working
as
a
spy
in
france
he
learns
that
the
man
is
a
spy
in
the
prison
where
darnay
is
held
and
he
blackmails
the
man
into
granting
him
access
to
darnay
mr
lorry
remarks
solemnly
that
this
will
not
help
darnay
carton
says
he
knows
this
and
darnay's
fate
seems
irrevocably
sealed
carton
however
has
other
plans
he
goes
to
the
prison
on
the
day
of
charles'
execution
on
the
pretense
of
visiting
him
one
last
time
but
once
he
gets
inside
he
uses
his
physical
resemblance
to
darnay
and
his
ability
to
manipulate
the
spy
to
pull
off
the
ultimate
sacrifice
he
drugs
darnay
into
a
stupor
switches
clothing
with
him
and
has
the
spy
smuggle
darnay
out
of
the
prison
and
into
a
waiting
carriage
that
also
includes
dr
manette
lucie
and
mr
lorry
he
tells
no
one
of
his
plan
and
not
even
the
manettes
know
it
they
are
waiting
in
their
carriage
for
carton
fully
expecting
that
he
will
join
them
and
that
they
will
leave
france
in
a
hurry
the
rest
of
the
family
is
in
danger
because
of
madame
defarge
who
wants
to
denounce
all
of
them
the
peasant
that
the
evr&eacutemonde
brothers
murdered
was
her
brother
and
she
wants
revenge
against
darnay
and
his
entire
family
the
spy
smuggles
charles
to
the
waiting
carriage
and
the
family
escapes
france
carton
however
goes
to
the
guillotine
and
dies
for
lucie
fulfilling
his
promise
to
her
that
he
would
die
to
keep
a
life
you
love
beside
you
just
before
he
dies
he
thinks
to
himself
that
his
final
act
is
far
better
than
anything
else
