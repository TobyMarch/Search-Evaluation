review
watership
down
has
been
a
staple
of
highschool
english
classes
for
years
despite
the
fact
that
it's
often
a
hard
sell
at
first
(what
teenager
wouldn't
cringe
at
the
thought
of
400plus
pages
of
talking
rabbits?)
richard
adams's
bunnycentric
epic
rarely
fails
to
win
the
love
and
respect
of
anyone
who
reads
it
regardless
of
age
like
most
great
novels
watership
down
is
a
rich
story
that
can
be
read
(and
reread)
on
many
different
levels
the
book
is
often
praised
as
an
allegory
with
its
analogs
between
human
and
rabbit
culture
(a
fact
sometimes
used
to
goad
skeptical
teens
who
resent
the
challenge
that
they
won't
get
it
into
reading
it)
but
it's
equally
praiseworthy
as
just
a
corking
good
adventure
the
story
follows
a
warren
of
berkshire
rabbits
fleeing
the
destruction
of
their
home
by
a
land
developer
as
they
search
for
a
safe
haven
skirting
danger
at
every
turn
we
become
acquainted
with
the
band
and
its
compelling
culture
and
mythos
adams
has
crafted
a
touching
involving
world
in
the
dirt
and
scrub
of
the
english
countryside
complete
with
its
own
folk
history
and
language
(the
book
comes
with
a
lapine
glossary
a
guide
to
rabbitese)
as
much
about
freedom
ethics
and
human
nature
as
it
is
about
a
bunch
of
bunnies
looking
for
a
warm
hideyhole
and
some
mates
watership
down
will
continue
to
make
the
transition
from
classroom
desk
to
bedside
table
for
many
generations
to
come

when
i
went
off
for
my
first
semester
of
college
my
father
gave
me
$100
with
which
to
buy
textbooks
which
certainly
dates
me
after
buying
everything
for
my
classes
i
had
enough
money
left
over
to
buy
a
hard
cover
copy
of
watership
down
by
richard
adams
for
$695
which
for
people
who
love
books
is
certainly
a
great
way
of
representing
the
ravages
of
inflation
over
the
years
i
decided
to
read
a
chapter
of
watership
down
each
night
before
going
to
bed
thereby
marking
the
beginning
of
my
obsession
with
reading
a
chapter
of
something
each
day
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
school
when
my
dorm
roommate
became
as
hooked
on
the
story
as
much
as
i
was
he
and
i
would
read
chapters
aloud
fifty
days
i
got
to
the
book's
epilogue
with
the
same
sort
of
sadness
that
it
was
all
over
that
i
experienced
getting
to
the
end
of
the
the
lord
of
the
rings
trilogy
living
in
the
sandleford
warren
with
its
chief
rabbit
and
owsla
maintaining
a
comfortable
social
order
hazel
and
his
little
brother
fiver
are
content
enough
but
fiver
has
the
gift
of
prophecy
and
when
he
warns
that
the
warren
has
to
be
abandoned
right
away
or
they
are
all
going
to
die
hazel
and
a
small
circle
of
friends
believe
him
and
leave
despite
the
fact
that
have
no
idea
where
they
are
going
fiver
envisions
a
great
high
place
where
they
can
be
happy
and
safe
but
there
are
a
series
of
imposing
obstacles
to
overcome
from
not
only
humans
and
predators
but
other
wild
rabbits
as
well
consequently
the
basic
story
of
watership
down
is
the
ancient
quest
for
home
although
in
this
case
it
is
a
new
home
that
represents
a
wild
rabbit's
idea
of
utopia
the
greatness
of
watership
down
rests
on
the
sense
of
realism
that
adams
brings
to
his
story
wild
rabbits
adams
studied
lapine
life
in
r
m
lockley's
the
private
life
of
the
rabbit
in
order
to
keep
his
rabbits
real
but
beyond
the
way
rabbits
live
in
nature
adams
provides
them
with
a
history
and
a
culture
represented
not
only
in
the
stories
they
tell
of
elahrairah
(the
prince
with
a
thousand
enemies)
but
their
beliefs
in
frith
the
lord
sun
and
their
simple
games
such
as
bobstones
when
confronted
with
sticky
situations
they
are
able
to
use
their
ingenuity
to
come
up
with
surprising
solutions
that
are
still
within
the
realm
of
possibility
for
real
rabbits
i
always
liked
the
way
hazel
blackberry
and
the
others
have
to
work
out
these
puzzles
straining
for
a
leap
of
intuition
and
cognitive
insight
that
seems
just
beyond
the
reach
of
their
relatively
simple
minds
so
while
these
rabbits
are
capable
of
doing
more
than
others
of
their
kind
adams
keeps
their
efforts
remarkable
rather
than
magical
we
also
pick
up
a
few
choice
words
from
the
language
of
the
rabbits
(eg
silflay
is
to
go
above
ground
to
feed
homba
is
a
fox)
which
ends
up
paying
off
with
one
of
my
favorite
moments
in
the
book
when
bigway
utters
a
simple
but
effective
curse
the
lesson
of
the
story
is
clearly
that
bigger
does
not
mean
better
for
hazel
is
neither
the
strongest
nor
the
smartest
of
the
rabbits
that
he
leads
but
he
had
the
best
qualities
of
leadership
each
of
the
rabbits
that
join
hazel
on
the
quest
to
find
watership
down
and
build
a
new
life
there
offers
something
to
the
ground
and
the
distinctive
personalities
that
adams
creates
for
each
of
them
adds
to
the
novel
as
well
of
all
the
books
that
i
have
that
i
like
to
pick
up
from
time
to
time
and
read
again
my
favorite
parts
watership
down
is
the
oldest
as
a
children's
story
is
it
simply
one
that
is
too
good
for
most
children
but
without
the
deep
allegorical
elements
that
afflict
so
many
other
great
children's
stories
perhaps
that
is
why
this
novel
has
become
so
beloved
because
it
speaks
to
the
child
in
all
of
us
and
the
simple
virtues
that
we
all
want
the
world
to
embody
having
read
the
book
again
from
start
to
finish
i
was
not
surprised
to
find
that
it
is
still
as
good
as
i
thought
it
was
when
i
first
read
it
many
years
ago

it
is
heartwarming
(in
the
extreme
for
me)
to
see
so
many
glowing
and
informative
reviews
about
this
incredible
book
i
read
watership
down
when
i
was
in
junior
high
and
remembered
liking
it
very
much
then
life
got
busy
and
i
pretty
much
forgot
about
it
but
occasionally
i'd
see
it
on
the
bookshelves
at
my
local
library
or
bookstore
and
an
itch
would
start
in
the
back
of
my
mind
telling
me
that
i
should
revisit
its
magical
pages
so
this
winter
i
did



how
wonderful
it
is
to
visit
such
a
fully
realized
world
created
by
the
human
mind
but
set
in
an
anthropomorphic
background
(and
foreground
too!)
the
story
is
about
a
band
of
rabbitshazel
bigwig
fiver
dandelion
and
bluebellwho
set
off
from
their
comfy
holes
to
find
a
new
rabbit
warren
on
the
plains
of
watership
down
they
leave
their
original
warren
because
fiver
(a
small
brooding
rabbit
with
'the
sight')
has
a
vision
of
it
being
destroyed
not
surprisingly
soon
after
they
leave
they
find
out
that
the
warren
had
been
destroyed
by
big
hrududil
(tractors)
that
dug
up
the
ground
and
killed
all
those
who
remained
behind
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
hazel
and
his
band
of
rogue
rabbits
carries
the
story
along
at
a
leisurely
pace
not
rushing
to
get
the
story
out
giving
rabbit
history
and
mythology
a
few
welldeserved
pages
too
after
hazel
and
his
fellow
bunnies
set
up
their
new
warren
on
watership
down
though
they
find
that
they
have
a
serious
problem
no
does
(females)!
without
does
their
new
warren
is
doomed
to
failure
so
they
set
about
trying
to
locate
some
breeding
stock
but
what
they
encounter
is
a
terrible
warren
known
as
efrafa
run
by
the
overbearing
and
callous
general
woundwort
the
battle
between
watership
down
and
efrafa
is
terrible
and
exciting
reading
even
for
adults
one
other
thing
that
struck
me
about
reading
this
book
(even
years
later)
is
that
there
are
so
many
things
discussed
in
it
of
an
adult
nature
rabbit
miscarriages
battles
sexual
connotations
death
and
dying
all
are
covered
within
these
simple
pages
and
it's
done
so
effortlessly
(thank
you
mr
adams)
the
story's
flow
is
never
interrupted
this
book
was
first
published
in
1972
(a
limited
release
no
less)
in
england
the
publisher
wasn't
sure
if
it
would
be
well
received
since
it
really
wasn't
a
children's
tale
nor
adult
literature
thank
god
they
took
a
chance
on
it
if
they
hadn't
we
would
surely
have
been
denied
a
true
literary
classic

a
lot
of
reviewers
teachers
and
other
people
that
like
to
make
themselves
sound
intellectually
mature
would
tell
you
that
in
order
to
enjoy
watership
down
or
any
other
book
for
that
matter
is
to
read
deep
meanings
in
to
every
aspect
of
the
book
please
do
yourself
a
favor
and
don't
torture
yourself
in
this
way
although
it
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
great
book
a
modern
day
classic
even
and
could
be
full
of
sybolism
and
irony
i
feel
that
it
is
best
enjoyed
by
taking
it
for
what
it
is
a
great
story
about
a
group
of
rabbit's
adventure
failure
success
selfdiscovery
and
their
long
journey
the
story
is
set
in
the
english
countryside
with
great
descriptions
of
the
surroundings
as
well
as
the
rabbits
and
their
lifestyle
it
is
told
from
a
rabbits
point
of
view
but
one
that
knows
human
behavior
as
well
and
somehow
adams
makes
the
whole
thing
realistic
the
book
is
about
a
group
of
rabbits
that
decide
to
leave
their
home
warren
after
fiver
a
sort
of
psychic
rabbit
tells
them
that
danger
is
on
the
way
and
so
they
begin
a
voyage
that
will
change
their
lives
forever
along
the
way
theyt
encounter
an
evil
warren
crows
a
fox
rivers
a
rabbit
farm
and
countless
other
dangers
their
final
destination
is
a
sort
of
rabbit
heaven
a
beautiful
safe
secure
piece
of
land
known
as
watership
down
also
included
in
the
book
is
a
whole
new
language
that
adams
somehow
brings
the
reader
to
understand
and
tales
of
how
frith
the
sun
god
was
so
impressed
with
elarairah
(a
folk
hero)
that
he
granted
him
wonderful
boons
when
i
was
first
told
of
the
book
i
thought
it
would
be
a
cute
kids
book
i
was
completely
wrong
this
is
a
mature
book
that
would
probably
be
best
suited
for
middleschool
students
through
adults
i
would
recommend
this
book
to
anyone
that
isn't
afraid
to
spend
a
little
time
and
become
fully
engrossed
in
a
wonderful
tale
