the
closest
to
abba
you
ever
will
get!
with
the
true
original
sound
and
the
right
matching
clothes
katja
nord

camilla
hedr&eacuten
will
bring
some
of
the
greatest
moments
in
pop
history
back
to
life
the
band
waterloo
was
formed
by
katja
nord
and
camilla
dahlin
(now
hedr&eacuten)
and
started
performing
in
clubs
around
sweden
in
1996
naturally
the
band
immediately
began
to
make
exact
copies
of
the
famous
waterloo
costumes
the
former
abba
sax
player
ulf
andersson
was
the
band’s
guest
of
honor
at
the
very
first
waterloo
show
katja
and
camilla
continued
to
establish
themselves
on
the
swedish
market
and
went
to
belgium
for
their
first
international
performance
in
1998
after
the
concert
katja
and
camilla
were
in
a
taxi
on
the
way
back
to
the
hotel
when
the
driver
suddenly
turned
around
and
said
“you
look
exactly
like
abba!”
this
speaks
for
itself
in
fact
any
person
that
has
had
the
opportunity
to
see
and
listen
to
waterloo
can
agree
to
that
it
is
a
very
convincing
show
they
could
easily
be
taken
for
the
real
abba
norway
discovered
waterloo
and
a
long
collaboration
started
in
2000
establishing
waterloo
as
the
number
one
abba
band
in
norway
later
the
same
year
katja
and
camilla
were
selected
as
one
of
the
ten
competitors
in
the
european
soundmix
contest
“stars
in
euro
eyes”
which
was
held
in
manchester

16

abba
–
the
show
played
a
3week

through
norway
denmark
and
sweden

sold
out
and
the
reviews
saluted
the
concept
in
2002
waterloo
continued
doing
a
lot
of
festivals
and
company
shows
in
scandinavia
during
the
spring

they
did
a
second
tour
with
abba
–
the

this
time
to
estonia

a
2week

guests
of
honor
several
houses
were
sold
out
and
the
tour
was
a
success
that
led
to
a
return
in
october
this
time
to
arizona
during
the
nasty
winter
weather
in
2004
waterloo
went
on
a
short
promotional
tour
to
the
philippines
hoping
to
get
a
day
on

were
met
with
four
hectic
days
of
tv
performances
press
conferences
radio
interviews
two
packed
concerts
and
the
associated
autograph
hunters
the
philippines
were
followed
by
a
very
successful

not
bad
at
all!

tour
waterloo
had
the
honor
of
presenting
yet
another
