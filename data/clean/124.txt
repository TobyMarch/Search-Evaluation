recently
i
saw
albert
brooks
on
late
night
with
david
letterman
talking
about
finding
nemo
brooks
who
stars
as
the
voice
of
marlon
the
daddy
fish
had
taken
his
son
(who
i
believe
was
about
five
years
old
the
equivalent
human
age
of
nemo)
to
the
premiere
after
about
five
minutes
brooks
said
his
son
leaned
over
to
him
and
quietly
said
the
way
a
grownup
might
i
cannot
watch
this
movie
and
walked
out
late
in
the
movie
the
son
returned
having
obviously
been
crying
leaning
over
brooks
assured
his
son
you
are
not
nemo
such
is
the
power
of
this
fish
story
about
father
and
son
clownfish
who
become
separated
and
must
struggle
to
find
their
way
back
to
each
other
marlon
is
a
loving
but
neurotic
and
overprotective
father
nemo
is
a
frustrated
young
fish
who
wants
to
be
independent
and
see
the
world
and
resents
his
father
for
preventing
him
from
doing
so
we
see
an
ocean
(read
the
world)
that
is
a
terrible
heartless
and
yet
joyous
place
that
we
frail
fish
must
confront
as
best
we
can
because
there's
no
alternative
the
animation
was
done
by
the
wonderful
folks
from
pixar
who
are
the
closest
thing
to
the
reincarnation
of
walt
disney
there
is
simply
no
comparison
between
the
animation
of
the
typical
visually
flat
politically
correct
contemporary
animated
movie
(many
of
which
are
produced
by
walt
disney
pictures!)
and
nemo
in
nemo
the
ocean
floor
looks
like
the
ocean
and
the
characters
are
all

characters
they
are
all
physically
distinctive
wonderfully
written
and
performed
by
gifted
actors
who

if
you'll
pardon
the
clich&eacute

will
alternately
make
you
laugh
and
cry
of
particular
note
are
barry
humphries
as
bruce
the
shark
geoffrey
rush
as
nigel
the
pelican
willem
dafoe
as
gill
allison
janney
as
peach
and
of
course
young
alexander
gould
as
nemo
ellen
degeneres
in
particular
steals
every
scene
she's
in
as
dory
a
gregarious
fish
whose
memory
leaks
like
a
sieve
but
this
is
albert
brooks'
movie
the
academy
should
give
this
man
a
special
oscar
for
the
most
moving
voice
work
my
wife
and
i
have
ever
heard
thomas
newman
of
the
musical
newman
clan
(alfred
lionel
randy)
has
produced
a
score
that
is
subtle
and
unobtrusive
much
of
the
time
but
at
dramatic
moments
takes
over
and
is
more
impressive
with
repeated
viewings
he
deserves
his
fifth
oscar
nomination
for
nemo
andrew
stanton's
(toy
story
monsters
inc)
screenplay
written
with
bob
peterson
and
david
reynolds
brims
with
intelligence
and
wit
(eg
in
an
aastyle
group
of
recovering

and
frequently
lapsing

sharks
the
members
intone
i
am
a
nice
shark
not
an
eating
machine
fish
are
friends
not
food)
and
stanton's
direction
does
not
waste
a
scene
every
moment
in
nemo
will
either
charm
you
or
move
you
in
fact
as
my
wife
remarked
for
all
of
its
many
comic
scenes
this
is
one
of
the
most
moving
movies
you'll
ever
see
we've
already
seen
it
several
times
with
our
threeandahalfyearold
son
who
loves
it
and
yet
with
each
new
viewing
we
notice
things
we'd
previously
missed
though
i
wish
nemo
would
win
all
of
the
big
oscars
(best
picture
director
screenplay)
i
doubt
academy
voters
will
choose
it
over
its
liveaction
competition
and
yet
i
will
be
very
surprised
if
a
better
picture

live
action
or
animated

is
released
this
year
finding

pixar's
getting
in
a
habit
of
constantly
outdoing
themselves
june
7
2003
by
gary
jaffe
finding
nemo
is
the
fifth
installment
for
pixar
studios
the
most
reliable
studio
in
hollywood
today
and
it
is
my
personal
favorite
the
first
obviously
outstanding
aspect
of
the
movie
is
the
animation
from
the
breathtaking
wonder
of
the
great
barrier
reef
to
the
cold
sterile
fish
tank
the
animation
is
top
notch
and
truly
state
of
the
art
the
water
which
has
always
been
the
bane
of
animation
is
picture
perfect
and
the
animators
have
captured
the
rolling
but
constant
ocean
and
the
light
refractions
perfectly
but
animation
itself
doesn't
make
a
film
finding
nemo's
strongest
aspect
is
it's
warm
witty
heartfelt
and
funny
story
of
a
father's
quest
to
reclaim
his
son
the
kids
will
love
the
vibrant
characters
and
funny
situations
and
so
will
the
parents
however
the
parents
will
be
able
to
enjoy
the
film
on
a
level
far
more
than
the
kids
will
the
story
is
about
losing
a
child
and
the
desperate
quest
to
be
reunited
which
will
hit
the
parent
right
in
the
gut
this
is
the
story's
dark
side
which
has
thankfully
not
been
sugar
coated
by
the
creators
overall
lets
just
say
halleluja
pixar
you've
done
it
again!

the
coolest
movie
i
have
ever
seen
may

by
michelle
you
must
see
this
movie
there
now
that
i've
said
that
i
should
tell
you
that
this
is
not
solely
a
childrens'
movie
but
will
be
enjoyed
as
much
(if
not
more)
by
adults
the
cleverness
of
pixar
will
never
cease
to
amaze
me
only
they
could
take
a
concept
like
a
fulllength
movie
about
fish
and
make
it
totally
believable
this
film
succeeds
n
being
very
very
funny
heck
i'm
16
and
saw
it
in
the
theater
with
only
my
mother
the
two
of
us
were
laughing
hysterically
throughout
the
entire
thing!
there's
alot
of
sadness
and
emotion
in
this
movie
and
some
absolutely
terrific
voice
actingthe
voice
cast
is
topnotch
there
are
some
touching
moments
and
subtle
messages
to
be
heard
by
all
not
just
kids
i
look
forward
with
anticipation
to
the
dvd
release
of
this
wonderful
movie
the
suspense
never
lets
up
encounters
with
jellyfish
a
whale
and
a
deepsea
lanturn
fish
make
every
moment
exciting
as
we
know
every
disney/pixar
film
is
associated
with
its
own
special
short
well
this
one
is
the
best
yet
and
the
short
film
sets
you
up
for
the
great
feelings
you'll
have
while
seeing
finding
nemo
i
won't
give
away
the
storyline
but
it
involves
a
cute
snowman
a
water
globe
and
some
tropical
souvenirs
that
completely
ready
one
for
the
overwhelming
tropicalness
of
the
feature
film
one
thing
i
can't
get
over
is
how
truetolife
these
characters
are
the
attention
to
finding
a
unique
species
for
each
fish
is
incredible
and
adds
a
whole
new
educational
dimension
to
the
movie
there
are
some
memorable
characters
in
finding
nemo
first
and
foremost
is
marlin
the
lovable
clownfish
who
is
an
overprotective
father
to
his
adventurous
son
nemo
then
there's
dory
the
regal
blue
tang
with
the
memory
problem
she
provides
much
of
the
comic
relief
but
is
also
an
immensely
real
character
bruce
is
a
mako
shark
who
wants
to
get
rid
of
the
typical
image
of
sharks
as
mindless
eating
machines
crush
is
a
150yearold
sea
turtle
with
a
coolsurferdude
attitude
nigel
is
a
helpful
pelican
the
whole
thing
takes
place
in
the
great
barrier
reef
off
the
coast
of
australia
and
then
there
are
the
aquarium
fish
who
invite
nemo
into
their
'club'
when
he
gets
scooped
from
the
sea
he
goes
through
the
initiation
ceremony
at
mt
wannahockaloogee
complete
with
tiki
statues
and
all
the
animation
is
awesome
their
group
includes
peach
the
lookout
starfish
deb
a
delusional
fish
who
thinks
her
reflection
is
her
sister
a
french
shrimp
a
puffer
fish
a
yellow
tang
and
a
royal
gramma
they
are
led
by
gill
a
moorish
idol
who
longs
to
return
to
the
ocean
this
film
is
excellent
it
deserves
a
sequel
overall
this
is
one
film
that
nobody
should
missparents
kids
or
otherwise
i
hope
this
review
has
convinced
you
to
go
get
yourself
a
ticket
to
finding
nemo
