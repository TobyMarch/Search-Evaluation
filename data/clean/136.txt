by
extractors
who

eventually

and
arthur
that
he
realizes
that
they've
invaded
his
subconscious
&nbspafter
a
brief
shootout
all
three
wake
up
in
what
appears
to
be
a
south
american
country
filled
with
rioters
&nbspthis
is
also
a
dream
so
the
previous
business
meeting
was
a
dreamwithinadream
&nbspthe
reality
is
that
cobb
arthur
and
another
person
have
induced
saito
into
sleeping/dreaming
on
a
train
in
japan
&nbspcobb
arthur
and
their
associate
wake
up
before
saito
and
walk
away
from
saito
leaving
saito
alone
on
the
train
cobb
sits
in
a
hotel
room
where
he
receives
a
phone
call
from
his
kids
&nbsphe
explains
that
he
can't
go
home
to
them
for
a
while
&nbsparthur
and
cobb
then
go
to
the
rooftop
to
a
helicopter
to
leave
japan
&nbspthey
are
surprised
to
see
saito
in
the
helicopter
&nbspit
turns
out
that
saito
was
testing
their
skills
and
wants
to
hire
them
for
a
job
&nbsphe
wants
them
to
plant
an
idea
(inception)
in
a
business
rival's
mind
&nbspsaito
wants
robert
fischer
(cillian
murphy)
the
son
of
another
industrialist
to
dissolve
his
business
empire
&nbspotherwise
fischer
will
control
more
than
half
of
the
world's
energy
supply
cobb
goes
to
paris
to
recruit
a
new
architect
of
dreams
&nbsphe
visits
michael
caine's
character
who's
an
architecture
professor
&nbspthey
recruit
ariadne
(ellen
page)
&nbspcobb
and
arthur
show
her
how
to
create
dream
environments
&nbspthey
also
establish
some
rules
and
practices
&nbspfor
example
cobb
and
arthur
have
totems
which
are
items
that
they
use
to
help
them
tell
that
they're
back
in
reality
cobb
uses
a
spinning
top
&nbspthe
top
spins
continuously
in
a
dream
world
but
in
the
real
world
the
top
stops
spinning
due
to
gravity
arthur
uses
a
loaded
die
&nbspariadne
makes
her
totem
out
of
a
bishop
chess
piece
&nbspcobb
also
recruits
eames
(tom
hardy)
who's
good
at
using
weapons
and
impersonating
other
people
once
inside
target's
dreams
and
yusuf
a
pharmacist
who
creates
chemicals
to
induce
deep
sleep
it's
easier
to
explain
some
of
the
ground
rules
first
before
continuing
with
the
story
there
are
two
main
ways
to
wake
up
from
a
dream
&nbspone
way
is
to
have
a
kick
initiated
by
the
sensation
of
falling
&nbspthe
other
way
is
to
die
unfortunately
if
you're
in
a
deep
sleep
dying
in
a
dream
is
not
a
good
idea
&nbspyou
could
be
stuck
in
mental
limbo
for
a
long
time
possibly
until
your
body
dies
for
real
in
the
real
world
a
target's
subconscious
projections
are
naturally
suspicious
of
intruders
&nbspa
welltrained
mind
will
have
defenses
against
intruders
&nbsprobert
fischer
has
been
prepared
by
mental
strategists
so
his
subconscious
creates
bodyguards
who
try
to
kill
cobb
and
his
team
since
time
passes
quicker
in
dreams
than
in
reality
an
hour
of
dreaming
can
feel
like
several
days
have
passed
even
though
they're
usually
in
someone
else's
subconscious
everyone
keeps
seeing
mallorie
if
cobb
is
inside
a
dream
with
them
&nbspcobb
is
unable
to
keep
his
memories
of
mallorie
compartmentalized
cobb
arthur
saito
eames
ariadne
and
yusuf
board
a
plane
from
sydney
to
los
angeles
&nbspthis
is
one
of
the
longest
commercial
flights
in
the
world
which
allows
the
team
ample
time
to
plant
an
idea
deep
within
robert
fischer's
subconscious
&nbspinception
is
difficult
because
a
mind
is
good
at
rejecting
foreign
ideas
here
are
the
dream
layers
during
this
part
of
the
movie
layer
1
everyone
goes
into
a
generic
city
&nbspcobb
and
his
team
abduct
robert
fischer
&nbspsaito
is
shot
in
this
dream
layer
but
because
they
are
in
deep
sleep
cobb
says
that
killing
saito
won't
cause
him
to
wake
up
&nbspsaito
might
just
stay
in
limbo
layer
2
yusuf
remains
awake
in
layer
1
&nbsphe
drives
a
van
&nbspeveryone
else
including
fischer
is
put
into
yet
another
dream
layer
&nbsplayer
2
takes
place
in
a
hotel
&nbspcobb
tells
fischer
that
his
mind
has
been
invaded
and
that
he
(cobb)
is
trying
to
help
fischer
fight
off
the
invaders
&nbspas
the
van
in
layer
1
is
attacked
and
eventually
starts
falling
into
a
river
gravity
is
disrupted
in
layer
2
&nbspsaito
coughs
up
blood
in
layer
2
even
though
he's
not
hurt
in
layer
2
layer

arthur
remains
awake
in
layer
2
as
he
fights
off
fischer's
subconscious
bodyguards
&nbspeveryone
else
goes
into
layer
3
which
has
everyone
trying
to
get
inside
a
fortress
on
top
of
a
snowy
mountain
&nbspcobb
tells
fischer
that
fischer's
father
has
a
secret
will
that
has
special
instructions
about
how
to
handle
his
business
empire
&nbspcobb's
hope
is
that
this
deep
in
fischer's
subconscious
fischer
will
think
that
dissolving
the
business
is
his
idea
&nbsphowever
fischer
is
shot
and
killed
in
layer
3
&nbspagain
saito
coughs
up
blood
even
though
he's
not
hurt
in
this
layer
layer

cobb
and
ariadne
go
into
layer
4
to
find
fischer
who's
now
in
limbo
having
died
in
layer
3
&nbspin
layer
4
cobb
finally
explains
to
ariadne
what
happened
to
mallorie
&nbspmany
years
ago
cobb
and
mallorie
went
into
deep
sleep
&nbspthey
spent
around
50
dream
years
together
and
mallorie
didn't
seem
to
want
to
leave
&nbsptherefore
cobb
planted
an
idea
in
her
subconscious
that
they
had
to
return
to
reality
&nbspunfortunately
once
back
in
reality
mallorie
never
believed
that
they
had
returned
to
reality
so
she
killed
herself
by
jumping
off
a
building
&nbspcobb
has
been
wracked
by
guilt
all
this
time
&nbsphe
cannot
return
to
the
us
because
they
authorities
think
that
he
killed
mallorie
ariadne
finds
fischer
in
limbo
and
goes
back
to
layer
3
with
him
&nbspcobb
stays
in
limbo
to
find
saito
who
has
also
died
in
layer
3
&nbspback
in
layer
3
fischer
finally
walks
into
a
room
where
he
thinks
he
sees
his
dying
father
&nbsphe
opens
a
safe
which
presumably
has
a
will
that
tells
fischer
that
he
should
break
up
his
company
the
movie
now
returns
to
its
opening
images
&nbspcobb
is
eating
dinner
with
the
old
man
at
the
beginning
of
the
movie
&nbspthe
old
man
is
saito
who's
been
trapped
in
limbo
for
a
long
time
(remember
dream
time
passes
faster
than
real
time)
there
is
a
montage
of
all
the
kicks
happening
as
the
characters
wake
up
from
the
various
layers
of
dreams
the
movie
then
cuts
to
all
of
the
characters
waking
up
on
an
airplane
&nbspsaito
makes
a
phone
call
and
the
characters
all
walk
through
immigration
without
being
arrested
&nbspcobb
is
picked
up
by
michael
caine's
character
and
they
go
to
a
home
where
cobb's
kids
are
playing
&nbspthey
are
wearing
the
same
clothes
that
cobb
usually
dreams
of
them
wearing
&nbspcobb
spins
the
top
on
a
table
before
going
to
play
with
his
kids
in
the
yard
&nbspthe
last
shot
of
the
movie
is
of
the
spinning
top
which
spins
for
a
very
long
time
&nbsp
the
movie
cuts
to
black
while
the
top
is
still
spinning
however
there
is
a
slight
wobble
just
as
the
film
ends
is
he
back
to
reality?
*cut
to
the
chase*
brought
to
you
by
from
curt
cobb
(leonardo
dicaprio)
and
his
team
specialize
in
a
very
unique
type
of
corporate
espionageextraction
or
the
invasion
of
their
targets'
dreams
to
steal
ideas
and
secrets
from
their
subconscious
minds
they
are
approached
by
saito
(ken
watanabe)
who
wants
to
hire
them
to
do
something
that
is
thought
to
be
impossibleinception
or
implantation
of
an
idea
into
the
subject's
mind
cobb
agrees
to
take
on
the
challenge
but
only
because
saito
offers
him
the
one
thing
in
the
world
he
wants
to
be
reunited
with
his
children
as
the
caper
(which
involves
four
levels
of
nested
dreams
intended
to
convince
fischer
(cillian
murphy)
that
he
has
independently
formulated
the
notion
to
break
up
his
father's
business
empire)
proceeds
it
is
revealed
that
cobb
has
done
inception
before
and
that
the
idea
he
inadvertently
implanted
in
his
wife
mal's
(marion
cotillard's)
subconscious
led
to
her
eventual
suicide
the
mission
appears
to
be
successful
in
all
respects
but
as
cobb
returns
to
his
home
and
embraces
his
children
the
final
shot
of
the
film
shows
mal's
metal
top
spinning
on
and
on
hinting
that
cobb
after
all
may
not
have
successfully
returned
to
reality
but
wait
just
before
the
film
cuts
to
black
the
metal
top
begins
to
wobble
which
indicates
that
this
is
not
a
dream
confirming
that
cobb
was
successful
in
his
mission
and
is
in
reality
reunited
with
his
family
