not

mark

and
the
hulk
in
the
avengers
the
general
consensus
among
most
people
who
went
to
see
the
avengers
earlier
this
year
was
that
of
all
the
colourful
superpowered
megatitans
on
display
in
joss
whedon's
genredefining
comicbook
ensemble
mark
ruffalo's
hulk
was
the
one
who
absolutely
smashed
it
imbuing
the
great
green
ragemonster's
alter
ego
bruce
banner
with
a
gentle
resigned
tristesse
rather
than
the
rampant
(and
ultimately
boring)
torment
that
both
eric
bana
and
ed
norton's
takes
seemed
to
suffer
from
ruffalo
left
space
for
the
character's
comic
side
to
emerge

many
expected
that

to
be
one
of
the
first
to
emerge
in
the
wake
of
the
avengers'
blockbuster
success
with
the

execs
have
been
greenlighting
comicbook
movies
like

is
going
out
of
fashion
as
well
as
sequels
to
captain

thor
iron
man
and
the
avengers
itself
marvel
last
month
saw
fit
to
put
the
offbeat
and
little
known
guardians
of
the
galaxy
into
production
but
still
no
announcement
of
a
new
hulk
movie
interviewed
at
the
toronto
film
festival
where
he
is
promoting
his
new
film
thanks
for
sharing
ruffalo
appeared
to
suggest
that
marvel
have
given
up
on
the
idea
after
both
ang
lee's
hulk
in
2003
and
louis
leterrier's
the
incredible
hulk
in
2008
failed
to
set
the
world
on
fire
i
think
they've
done
it
i
think
they
feel
that
they've
done
that
ruffalo
told
mtv
news
i
think
they
don't
really
know
where
to
go
[with
the
character]
if
true
this
looks
to
me
like
a
rather
admirable
admission
of
failure
the
character
does
seem
to
need
other
figures
to
bounce
off
on
the
big
screen
all
the
best
laughs
in
the
avengers
featured
cgi
ruffalo's
nononsense
brutal
and
bombastic
entanglements
with
friends
and
enemies
alike
so
perhaps
he's
better
used
for
cameo
appearances
in
films
driven
by
other
comicbook
heroes
the
hulk's
personality
it
seems
only
really
blooms
when
he
has
to
deal
with
other
people
perhaps
sad
hulk
as
we'll
call
him
belongs
on
the
small
screen
wandering
miserably
around
small
town
america
to
the
strains
of
the
1970s
tv
series'
maudlin
end
credits
theme
fans
of
the
lou
ferrigno
era
will
be
pleased
to
note
that
there
are
plans
afoot
to
create
a
new
show
though
ruffalo
does
not
seem
likely
to
be
involved
have
producers
made
the
right
call
here?
elsewhere
in
the
rapidly
expanding
marvel
universe
this
week
rumours
abound
that
doctor
strange
may
turn
up
in
thor
the
dark
world
(the
upcoming
thor
sequel)
some
reports
had
suggested
that
none
other
than
viggo
mortensen
himself
might
be
set
to
portray
the
cosmic
sorcerer
a
story
emanating
from
the
twitter
account
of
one
roger
wardell
who
has
been
furiously
tweeting
rumours
about
a
whole
range
of
marvel
upcoming
projects
for
months
people
began
listening
when
his
prediction
that
falcon
would
be
appearing
in
captain
america
the
winter
soldier
was
confirmed
elsewhere
unfortunately
marvel
executive
victoria
alonso
has
shot
down
any
suggestion
that
mortensen
is
involved
with
upcoming
projects
which
would
it
has
to
be
said
have
been
a
pretty
impressive
coup
we
would
love
to
work
with
viggo
mortensen
i've
been
trying
that
for
years
she
told
worst
previews
but
i
don't
know
if
viggo
is
even
acting
anymore
i
thought
he
wasn't
acting
anymore
it
would
be
great
to
work
with
him
in
the
future
but
we
don't
have
him
signed
no
it's
nevertheless
intriguing
to
note
some
of
wardell's
other
exclusives
apparently
the
mandarin
will
be
the
main
villain
in
iron
man
3
and
marvel
are
seriously
considering
getting
gwyneth
paltrow's
pepper
potts
to
pull
on
a
power
suit
in
the
same
film
wardell
also
reckons
shots
from
the
avengers
will
be
recycled
for
the
forthcoming
tv
show
on
the
abc
network
in
the
us
whedon
himself
however
this
week
told
mtv
news
the
show
would
most
likely
focus
on
different
characters
to
those
who
appeared
in
the
film
it
needs
to
be
its
own
thing
he
said
it
needs
to
be
adjacent
but
you
don't
want
to
do
a
show
where
you're
constantly
going
'iron
man
just
left
but
he
was
totally
here
a
minute
ago'
the
show's
main
figures
will
probably
not
have
superpowers
added
the
buffy
the
vampire
slayer
creator
that
makes
them
a
little
bit
–
even
though
they're
a
big
organisation
–
underdogs
and
that's
interesting
to
me
in
a
separate
interview
with
vulture
he
added
the
important
thing
to
me
is
that
we
know
what
the
show
is
we
love
what
it
is
it
came
together
very
organically
so
when
we
went
in
to
pitch
[to
marvel]
it
wasn't
like
'we're
trying
to
find
this
because
you
want
a
tv
show'
it
was
'check
this
out'
and
that's
a
good
way
to
walk
in
a
room
meanwhile
whedon
has
already
been
planning
his
sequel
to
the
avengers
at
least
in
terms
of
where
it
begins
the
creation
of
the
team
is
not
the
happy
ending
he
told
canada's
24
hours
it
is
the
beginning
of
something
that
is
complex
and
difficult
and
now
i
get
to
dig
a
little
deeper
and
maybe
while
i'm
digging
just
twist
that
knife
and
that's
exciting
for
me

the
hulk's
personality
it
seems
only
really
blooms
when
he
has
to
deal
with
other
people
true
in
the
comics
as
well
i
think

the
hulk
works
best
either
as
part
of
an
ensemble
or
when
he's
written
as
smarter
than
the
version
most
people
are
familiar
with
(which
has
actually
been
done
a
lot
of
the
time
since
the
late
80s)

all
i
will
say
is
that
i
only
hope
marvel
pays
the
vfx
studios
that
work
on
these
films
sufficiently
better
than
they
have
been
to
stop
these
post
production
houses
doing
a
ddmg
(digital
domain
media
group)

if
that
means
bigger
budgets
to
cope
and
less
films
as
a
consequence

so
be
it
marvel
has
said
it'll
stick
by
ddmg
after
the
awful
mess
that's
emerged
but
i'd
imagine
that
will
mean
that
marvel
will
have
to
increase
the
budget
to
ensure
that
ddmg
to
reliably
complete
the
shots
without
going
titsupcom
completely
a
very
fragile
situation
if
the
industry's
demand
of
heavy
vfx
based
films
continue
they
have
to
now
face
the
fact
it'll
cost
them
more
to
make
these
films
as
unionisation
and
bigger
bills
come
into
play
to
stop
the
multitude
of
vfx
shops
from
closing
down

which
is
happening
far
too
much
recently

five?
i'm
quite
a
fan
of
a
good
comic
book
action
movie
but
five
hulks
is
more
than
overkill
any
bet
they'll
do
two
hulk
movies
before
cutting
their
losses
the
first
one
will
do
well
the
second
will
be
a
big
floppy
cock
and
there
won't
be
a
third

i
think
they
mean
5
marvel
movies
not
5
hulk
movies
so
that's
ruffalo
contracted
for
at
least
2
more
avengers
movies
and
maybe
a
cameo
or
two
in
subsequent
iron
man
thor
or
captain

the
hulk
is
a
complex
character
anyone
familiar
with
the
comics
can
attest
to
this
also
the
ang
lee
film
was
great
the
second
film
was
a
waste
of
celluloid

the
hulks
always
been
my
favourite
but
i
think
a
decision
not
to
do
another
hulk
stand
alone
film
may
be
a
wise
one
that
said
i
really
think
the
ang
lee
film's
brilliant
(well
apart
from
the
cgi
which
is
a
bit
rubbish
and
apparently
caused
by
ang's
insistence
to
have
an
almost
luminous
hue
to
the
big
guy)
also

wtf
a
guardian
post
about
mavel
films
which
hasn't
mentioned
ant
man?
let
the
entire
gravity
of
how
awesome
this
film
will
be
seep
into
your
skull
a
film
directed
by
scott
pilgrim/hotfuzz's
edgar
write
about
a
superhero
who
can
shrink
to
any
size
and
telepathically
communicate
with
ants
oh
and
also
grow
to
any
size
thereby
becoming
giant
man

as

loved
the
avengers
it
seems
a
bit
of
waste
of
whedon's
talents
to
have
him
endlessly
adapt
marvel
comics
into
films
and

sorry
we
can't
have
a
thread
where
two
people
say
how
brilliant
ang
lee's
hulk
was
without
someone
bringing
upt
the
objective
fact
that
is
one
of
the
worst
films
ever
made
nonsensical
story
terrible
characterisation
dull
special
effects
editing
presumably
done
by
a
blind
child
plus
the
terrible
mistake
by
lee
in
thinking
that
fans
of
comics
like
them
because
they
like
he
frames
and
'meanwhile'
boxes
rather
than
that
they
like
them
because
they
have
the
imagination
to
overcome
those
limitations
just
really
really
awful
and
silly
an
egregious
pile
of
crap
by
contrast
the
one
that
edward
norton
was
in
seemed
fine
to
me
in
that
it
wasn't
actively
offensive
just
a
bit
bland

you
are
correct
sir
norton
was
a
better
banner
and
lee's
comic
book
style
was
a
disaster
also
they
messed
with
the
fine
character
'absorbing
man'
who
should
be
crusher
cree

ang
lee's
film
wasn't
a
great
film
true
(the
hulk
dogs
were
somewhat
unecessary
i
feel)
but
it
was
okay
in
any
case
i
much
preffered
bana
over
norton
(too
much
acting)
but
i
do
think
ruffelo
nailed
the
banner
role
perfectly
what
i
really
liked
about
the
avenger's
film
and
all
the
latest
marvel
films
is
that
they
know
what
they
are
ie
comic
book
adaptations
and
not
adaptations
of
great
works
of
literature
and
include
the
humour
and
images
that
we
all
bought
them
for
the
best
scene
in
the
whole
avenger's
film
is
by
far
the
bit
where
the
hulk
confronts
loki
when
loki
declares



i
am
a
god!



you
just
know
that
there
will
then
be
a
climatic
scene
where
the
god
will
embrace
the
hulk
with
lightning
bolts
and
portentious
words
the
hulk
will
be
brought
to
his
knees
before
crawling
towards
his
foe
and
finally
smiting
him
with
his
final
breath
before
finally
succumbing
to
his
wounds
transforming
back
to
dr
banner
and
dying
surrounded
by
his
grief
stricken
team
mates(all
ala
star
wars)
at
least
that
is
what
should
have
happened
but
for
the
hulk
to
simply
slam
loki
across
the
floor
ala
warner
brothers
was
a
bit
of
genius
more

anyone
that

hulk
punching
thor
was
one
of

comedy
in

had
me

i'll
agree
that
some
of
the
special
effects
were
crap
the
hulk
himself
was
too
green
making
him
hard
to
accept
as
believable
but
what
makes
it
good
(in
my
opinion)
is
that
ang
lee
gets
the
hulk
batman
is
the
dark
embodiment
of
rough
justice
and
fear
spiderman
is
a
story
about
becoming
a
man
(with
superpowers)
and
superman
is
a
more
boring
version
of
jesus
but
the
hulk
is
all
about
limitless
anger
and
power
and
how
much
fun
they
are
the
bad
guy
is
always
immaterial
for
the
hulk
because
it's
not
really
about
saving
anyone
the
villain's
are
just
anger
inducing
catalysts
fittingly
the
bits
out
in
the
desert
gave
a
great
impression
of
the
freedom
banner
experience's
when
he's
the
hulk
running
at
60mph
and
being
able
to
jump
into
the
stratosphere
the
finale
was
not
a
slogfest
(because
the
hulk
automically
wins
any
slogfest)
it
was
a
display
of
the
limitless
anger
of
banners
psyche
it
was
also
highly
weird
and
had
bubbles
and
shit
my
point
is
it
was
a
great
exploration
of
what
the
hulk
symbolises
conversely
(and
i
say
this
as
a
massive
ed
norton
fan)
the
second
film
was
as
beige
as
70's
living
room

it

i
honestly
think
they
shouldn't
make
anymore
hulk
films
and
just
keep
him
as
an
avengers
only
deal
hulk
was
so
much
better
in
the
avengers
then
in
his
own
movies
because
he
was
quite
literally
let
loose
the
solo
films
have
banner's
personal
issues
front
and
centre
which
has
already
gotten
more
then
a
little
stale
but
you
can't
just
have
2
hours
of
hulk
smashing
stuff
either
it
adds
more
exclusivity
to
the
film
as
people
will
flock
to
see
the
big
guy
tear
stuff
up
again
like
he
did
in
the
first
avengers
plus
you
can
just
enjoy
the
character
for
what
it
is
rather
than
having
to
add
any
more
unnecessary
depth
to
him

i
think
the
best

adaptation
out
at
the
moment
is
the
avenger
cartoon
series
avengers
earth's
mightiest
heroes
it
shows
real
reverence
to
source
material
drawing
on
all
eras
of
the
comics
and
the
films
and
it
is
the
only
time
i
have
seen
a
big
superhero
teamup
with
all
the
proper
avengers
including
captain
america
black
panther
wasp
thor
etc
it
also
features
fantastic
four
spiderman
and
the
xmen
its
brilliant
ultimate
spiderman
however
is
