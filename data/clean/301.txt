agatha
christie
who
wrote
the
book
in
1939
later
adapted
the
story
into
a
play
in
1943
(with
a
revised
ending)
the
various
film
versions
—
including
the
four

films
from
1945
1965
1975
and
1989
—
mostly
use
the
play's
ending
rather
than
the
book's
(which
makes
sense
once
you
know
the
book's
ending)
a

version
produced
in
1987

the
only

the

has
a
number
of
different
titles
as
a
direct
result
of

upon
its
release
the
book
bore
the
title
ten
little
niggers
(which
believe
it
or
not
1930s
britain
did
not
consider
racist)
in
the
us
publishers
changed
the
title
to
and
then
there
were
none
even
though
the
book
ended
up
published
as
ten
little

in
both
countries
people
eventually
saw
that
title
as
racist
and
then
there

more
or
less
become
the
official
standardized
title
(the
soviet
and
the
french
adaptation
retained

this
story
serves
as
the
trope
namer
for
the
tropes

remarks
that

however
it's

an
invoked

here
than
a
straight
example
once
the

is

fakes
his

admits
that
his
main
motive
was
that
he

compelled

that
he
still
feels

all

have
to
be

the
various

contain

if
you
want
to
listen
to
the

rant
at

of

you'd
better
make

the

you

a

twist
not

charles

who
came
in
lombard's
place
after
the
real
lombard
committed
suicide
upon
receiving
un
owen's
letter
and
in
the
game
you
have
two
dead

impersonators
one
is
morley
the
other
is
gabrielle
steel
masquerading
as
emily
brent
whom
she
did
away
with
earlier
as
part
of
her
plan
fanservice
in
the
1965
adaptation
shirley
eaton
in
the
role
of
vera
gets
quite
a
few
scenes
in
her
underwear
and
at
least
one
modesty
towel
in
the
russian
version
vera
also
gets
a
scene
in
her
black
underwear
which
is
followed
by
a
bare
back
shot
minutes
later
with
lombard
as
he
begins
to
rape
her
er
yeah
getting
crap
past
the
radar
in
the
play
emily
brent
makes
various
comments
on
vera
claythorne
not
wanting
to
appear
flashy
to
her
hostess
right
before
making
a
nasty
comment
on
how
tight
her
dress
appears
(with
vera
of
course
being
utterly
naive
as
to
what
she
really
means)
and
then
there
are
the
various
instances
of
lombard
flirting
with
vera
which
include
lombard's
line
about
being
regretful
he
and
vera
did
not
wake
up
at
the
same
time
because
they
could've
gone
down
to
the
ocean
to
have
a
bathe
together
hotter
and
sexier
the
1965
version
changed
the
elderly
spinster
character
to
a
glamorous
actress
solely
to
allow
another
beautiful
woman
to
be
cast
(a
change
that
would
be
retained
in
both
the
1975
and
1989
versions)
it
was
also
the
first
adaptation
of
a
christie
work
to
contain
a
sex
scene
(which
had
not
been
present
in
the
original

how
do
