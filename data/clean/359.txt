synopsis
the
book
makes
use
of
the
false
document
technique
and
opens
with
higgins
describing
his
discovery
of
the
concealed
grave
of
thirteen
german
paratroopers
in
an
english
graveyard
what
follows
was
inspired
by
the
real
life
rescue
of
hitler's
ally
benito
mussolini
by
otto
skorzeny
a
similar
idea
is
considered
by
hitler
with
the
strong
support
of
himmler
admiral
wilhelm
canaris
head
of
the
abwehr
(german
military
intelligence)
is
ordered
to
make
a
feasibility
study
of
the
seemingly
impossible
task
of
capturing
british
prime
minister
winston
churchill
and
bringing
him
to
the
reich
canaris
realizes
that
although
hitler
will
soon
forget
the
matter
himmler
will
not
fearing
himmler
may
try
to
discredit
him
canaris
orders
one
of
his
officers
oberst
radl
to
undertake
the
study
despite
feeling
that
it
is
all
just
a
waste
of
time
and
effort
an
unteroffizier
on
radl's
staff
finds
that
one
of
their
spies
code
named
starling
has
provided
a
tantalizing
piece
of
intelligence
at
any
other
time
in
any
other
place
this
information
would
be
useless
radl
said
and
then
synchronicity
rears
its
disturbing
head
winston
churchill
is
scheduled
to
spend
a
relaxing
weekend
at
a
country
house
near
the
village
of
studley
constable
norfolk
there
joanna
grey
an
afrikaner

longtime
abwehr
agent
lives
she
detests
england
because
she
was
abused
and
raped
by
british
soldiers
during
the
angloboer
war
as
a
result
of
her
reports
radl
devises
a
detailed
plan
to
intercept
churchill
and
return
with
him
to
germany
although
radl
is
certain
the
plan
has
real
possibilities
admiral
canaris
orders
him
to
abandon
it
himmler
however
has
already
learned
of
the
scheme
and
summons
radl
he
orders
him
to
proceed
but
without
notifying
canaris
in
response
radl
