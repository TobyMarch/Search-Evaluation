what's
the
story?
young
siblings
discover
that
a
wardrobe
in
an
old
country
house
is
a
portal
to
the
magical
land
of
narnia
there
edmund
meets
the
evil
white
witch
and
is
lured
into
betraying
his
siblings
but
the
plot
fails
the
lion
aslan
lord
of
narnia
returns
to
the
land
heralding
the
end
of
a
long
joyless
winter
and
the
children
who
continue
to
elude
the
witch's
grasp
meet
with
him
the
witch
demands
an
audience
with
aslan
and
announces
that
edmund
exposed
as
a
traitor
must
die
unknown
to
the
others
aslan
agrees
to
take
edmund's
place
and
submits
to
execution
however
he
comes
back
to
life
and
summons
anarmy
of
woodland
creatures
and
mythical
characters
in
time
to
help
peter
and
the
other
children
including
a
repentant
edmund
defeat
the
witch's
forces
and
bring
peace
to
narnia
after
years
of
ruling
narnia
the
children
return
through
the
wardrobe
to
find
that
time
has
stood
still
is
it
any
good?
&nbsp
unlike
the
works
of
his
friend
and
colleague
j
r
r
tolkien
author
of
the
hobbit
and
the
lord
of
the
rings
c
s
lewis'
chronicles
of
narnia
series
does
not
stand
up
as
well
to
the
test
of
time
written
a
halfcentury
ago
this
novel
occurring
in
an
imaginary
realm
visited
by
children
is
full
of
storyteller's
asides
and
precious
english
children
and
features
an
odd
mix
of
childish
adventure
and
bloody
battles
his
sometimes
heavyhanded
christian
allegory
(aslan
sacrifices
his
life
for
the
wayward
edmund
and
is
resurrected)
can
also
get
overwhelming
one
particularly
disturbing
scene
has
the
two
girls
witnessing
aslan
being
trussed
sheared
and
beaten
by
evil
gloating
creatures
a
nod
to
the
indignity
suffered
by
christ
before
his
crucifixion
young
children
who
are
read
this
story
may
enjoy
the
fairytale
aspects
but
older
kids
who
are
not
fans
of
fantasy
may
be
put
off
by
the
almost
laughable
repetition
of
scenes
in
which
the
children
are
comforted
by
the
sudden
availability
of
tea
and
the
way
the
forces
of
good
seem
to
have
too
easy
a
time
of
it
in
vanquishing
their
foes
other
stories
in
the
series
are
somewhat
more
fun

why

and
why
is
there

(hint
try
reading
the
first
book
in
the
narnia
chronicles
the

for
some
interesting
background)
if
parents
and
children
are
familiar
with
christianity
they
can
also
discuss
how
the
book's
plot
and
characters
are
like
various
stories
and
people
found

the
bible
for
example
how
is
aslan

reviewers
great
book
and
great
reading
great
story
that
lets
kids
get
absorbed
into
a
fantasy
world
that
is
built
around
them
in
classic
language
and
artistry
that
is
cs
lewis
the
commonsense
reviewer
feels
that
he
needs
to
tell
parents
that
this
is
dated
and
simple?
please!
why
not
warn
parents
about
books
that
have
vivid
descriptions
of
violent
acts
against
children
infanticide
and
other
inappropriate
content
for
these
ages?
many
newer
award
winning
books
that
get

are
current
and
are
trash
and
are
no

transparent

yeah
it's
totally
obvious
that
aslan
is
jesus
not
subtle
and
all
but
despite
that
(and
i'm
not
even
christian!)
i
still
loved
this
book
my
whole

got
really
into
it
one

so

get
into
it
