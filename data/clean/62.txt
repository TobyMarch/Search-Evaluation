alice

before

flutters
away
cast
and
characters
the
film
features
a
variety
of
characters
many
of
whom
are
based
on
characters
that
are
featured
in
works
by
lewis
carroll
mia
wasikowska
as
alice
kingsleigh
when
creating
the
character
screenwriter
linda
woolverton
researched
how
young
women
were
expected
to
behave
in
the
victorian
era
and
then
made
her
the
opposite[7]
wasikowska
read
carroll's
books
as
a
child
and
reread
them
to
prepare
for
her
role
she
also
watched
jan
švankmajer's
alice
she
said
when
we
were
kids
my
mum
would
pop
it
in
the
vcr
player
we
would
be
disturbed
and
wouldn't
really
understand
it
but
we
couldn't
look
away
because
it
was
too
intriguing
so
i
had
kept
that
feeling
about
alice
a
kind
of
haunting
feeling[8]
although
facing
pressures
to
conform
to
society's
expectations
alice
grows
into
a
strongerwilled
and
empowered
heroine
who
chooses
her
own
path
independent
columnist
liz
hoggard
praised
alice
as
a
role
model
for
girls
describing
the
character
as
stubborn
brave
[and]
nongirlie[7][9]
mairi
ella
challen
portrayed
alice
as
a
sixyearold[10]
helena
bonham
carter
as
the
red
queen
carter's
head
was
digitally
increased
to
three
times
its
original
size
in
the
film
johnny
depp
as
the
hatter[6]
wasikowska
said
that
the
characters
both
feel
like
outsiders
and
feel
alone
in
their
separate
worlds
and
have
a
special
bond
and
friendship[11][12]
burton
explained
that
depp
tried
to
find
a
grounding
to
the
character

as
opposed
to
just
being
mad[13]
burton
also
said
that
in
a
lot
of
versions
it's
a
very
onenote
kind
of
character
and
you
know
[depp's]
goal
was
to
try
and
bring
out
a
human
side
to
the
strangeness
of
the
character[13]
the
orange
hair
is
an
allusion
to
the
mercury
poisoning
suffered
by
milliners
who
used
mercury
to
cure
felt
depp
believes
that
the
character
was
poisoned

and
it
was
coming
out
through
his
hair
through
his
fingernails
and
eyes[14]
depp
and
burton
decided
that
the
hatter's
clothes
skin
hair
personality
and
accent
would
change
throughout
the
film
to
reflect
his
emotions[15]
in
an
interview
with
depp
the
character
was
paralleled
to
a
mood
ring
[as]
his
emotions
are
very
close
to
the
surface[16]
the
hatter
is
made
up
of
different
people
and
their
extreme
sides
with
a
gentle
voice
much
like
the
character's
creator
lewis
carroll
reflecting
the
lighter
personality
and
with
a
scottish
glaswegian
accent
(which
depp
modeled
after
gregor
fisher's
rab
c
nesbitt
character)
reflecting
a
darker
more
dangerous
personality[17]
illusionary

bernal
doubled
for
depp
during
the
futterwacken
sequence
near
the
end
of
the
film[18]
helena
bonham
carter
as
iracebeth
of
crims
the
red
queen
she
is
a
combination
of
the
red
queen
and
the
queen
of
hearts[6]
her
first
name
is
a
play
on
the
word
irascible
as
she
is
easily
irritated
and
quick
to
anger[19]
bonham
carter's
head
was
digitally
increased
to
three
times
its
original
size
on
screen[20][21]
the
character
hates
animals
choosing
to
use
them
as
servants
and
furniture[22]
the
actress
took
inspiration
from
her
young
daughter
nell
a
toddler
stating
that
the
red
queen
is
just
like
a
toddler
because
she's
got
a
big
head
and
she's
a
tyrant
anne
hathaway
as
mirana
of
marmoreal
the
white
queen[6]
she
was
one
of
few
characters
that
did
not
require
digital
manipulation[23]
hathaway
summed
up
her
character
with
a
caption
on
a
magnet
of
happy
bunny
holding
a
knife
cute
but
psycho
things
even
out[24]
according
to
hathaway
she
comes
from
the
same
gene
pool
as
the
red
queen
she
really
likes
the
dark
side
but
she's
so
scared
of
going
too
far
into
it
that
she's
made
everything
appear
very
light
and
happy
but
she's
living
in
that
place
out
of
fear
that
she
won't
be
able
to
control
herself[25]
hathaway
described
her
interpretation
of
the
white
queen
as
a
punkrock
vegan
pacifist
with
inspiration
drawn
from
debbie
harry
greta
garbo
and
the
artwork
of
dan
flavin[25]
burton
said
that
the
white
queen's
appearance
was
inspired
by
nigella
lawson[26]
crispin
glover
played
ilosovic
stayne
the
knave
of
hearts[6]
the
character
is
arrogant
and
tricky
and
while
following
the
red
queen's
every
order
he
is
the
only
one
capable
of
calming
her
dramatic
mood
swings
glover
said
the
red
queen
has
a
fair
amount
of
shorttempered
reactions
to
things
that
people
do
and
so
[the
knave]
has
to
be
quite
diplomatic
the
red
queen
believes
he
is
her
lover
but
his
attempt
to
seduce
alice
and
negative
reaction
to
being
exiled
with
the
red
queen
at
the
story's
end
proves
this
to
be
false
stayne's
body
was
completely
cgi
with
only
glover's
head
being
liveaction[27]
matt
lucas
portrayed
both
tweedledee
and
tweedledum
burton
commented
on
the
mixture
of
animation
and
lucas
saying
that
it's
a
weird
mixture
of
things
which
gives
his
characters
the
disturbing
quality
that
they
so
richly
deserve[28]

voices
michael
sheen
voiced
nivens
mctwisp
the
white
rabbit[6][30]
sheen
said
the
character
is
such
an
iconic
character
that
[he]
didn't
feel
like
[he]
should
break
the
mold
too
much[31]
burton
said
the
quality
he
wanted
most
in
his
clockwatching
bunny
was
a
twitchiness
also
commenting
that
[in]
any
incarnation
of
the
[white
rabbit]
through
the
years
there's
that
sort
of
nervousness
of
a
rabbit[31]
alan
rickman
voiced
absolem
the
caterpillar[6]
although
rickman
was
filmed
while
recording
his
voice
in
a
studio
his
face
was
not
composited
onto
the
character's
face
as
originally
planned[21]
barbara
windsor
voiced
mallymkun
the
dormouse[6]
burton
said
that
windsor's
voice
sealed
the
deal
for
her
role
as
the
character[32]
stephen
fry
voiced
chesshur
the
cheshire
cat[6][33]
burton
stated
that
the
character
had
a
creepy
quality
in
addition
to
tapping
into
his
own
hatred
of
cats[34][35]
paul
whitehouse
voiced
thackery
earwicket
the
march
hare[6]
burton
stated
that
because
whitehouse
is
a
great
comedic
actor
a
lot
of
his
lines
came
from
improvisation[36]
timothy
spall
voiced
bayard
the
bloodhound
although
bayard
does
not
appear
in
the
book
a
similar
character
named
the
puppy
may
be
the
inspiration
for
the
character
michael
gough
voiced
uilleam
the
dodo
bird[6]
burton
said
that
gough
was
the
first
person
he
thought
of
for
the
role
of
the
dodo
because
he
has
a
full
life
quality
to
his
voice[37]
ultimately
this
would
be
gough's
final
acting
role
the
actor
passed
away
the
following
year
at
the
age
of
ninetyfour
sir
christopher
lee
voiced
the
jabberwocky
while
it
only
had
two
lines
burton
said
that
he
felt
lee
to
be
a
good
match
for
the
iconic
character
because
he
is
an
iconic
guy[38]
imelda
staunton
voiced
the
talking
flowers
some
of
the
flowers'
faces
are
caricatures
of
staunton[39]
jim
carter
voiced
the
executioner
the
executioner
is
the
only
human
character
that
is
completely
animated[39]
frank
welker
provided
additional
voices
and
vocal
effects[39]
production
tim
burton
signed
with
disney
to
direct
two
films
in
disney
digital
3d
which
included
alice
in
wonderland[40]
and
his
remake
of
frankenweenie
burton
developed
the
story
because
he
never
felt
an
emotional
connection
to
the
original
book
with
its
series
of
events
about
a
girl
wandering
from
one
weird
character
to
another[41]
he
explained
the
goal
is
to
try
to
make
it
an
engaging
movie
where
you
get
some
of
the
psychology
and
kind
of
bring
a
freshness
but
also
keep
the
classic
nature
of
alice
on
prior
versions
burton
said
it
was
always
a
girl
wandering
around
from
one
crazy
character
to
another
and
i
never
really
felt
any
real
emotional
connection
his
goal
with
the
new
movie
is
to
give
the
story
some
framework
of
emotional
grounding
and
to
try
and
make
alice
feel
more
like
a
story
as
opposed
to
a
series
of
events[13]
burton
focused
on
the
poem
jabberwocky
as
part
of
his
structure[42]
and
refers

also
stated
that
he
does
not
see
his
version
as
either
a
sequel
to
any
existing
alice
film
nor
as
a
reimagining[41]
we
wanted
somebody
who
had
it's
hard
to
put
into
words
but
just
had
a
gravity
to
her
an
internal
life
something
that
you
could
see
the
wheels
turning
it's
just
a
simple
kind
of
power
to
her
that
we
really
liked
not
flamboyant
not
very
showy

this
film
was
originally
set
to
be
released
in
2009
but
was
pushed
back
to
march&nbsp5
2010[44]
principal
photography
was
scheduled
for
may&nbsp2008
but
did
not
begin
until
september
and
concluded
in
three
months[40][45]
scenes
set
in
the
victorian
era
were
shot
at
torpoint
and
plymouth
from
september&nbsp1
to
october&nbsp14
two
hundred
and
fifty
local
extras
were
chosen
in
early
august
locations
included
antony

in
torpoint
charlestown
cornwall
and
the
barbican[46][47]
however
no
footage
from
the
barbican
was
used

filming
began
in
early
october
at
sony

studios
in
culver
city
california
though
the
footage
was
later
discarded[48][49][50]
filming
also
took
place
at
culver
studios[51]
burton
said
that
he
used
a
combination
of
live
action
and
animation
without
motion
capture[52]
he
also
noted
that
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
filmed
on
a
green
screen[52]
filming
of
the
green
screen
portions
comprising
90%
of
the
film
was
completed
after
only
40
days[53]
many
of
the
cast
and
crew
felt
nauseated
as
a
result
of
the
long
hours
surrounded
by
green
with
burton
having
lavender
lenses
fitted
into
his
glasses
to
counteract
the
effect[53]
due
to
the
constant
need
for
digital
effects
to
distort
the
actors'
physical
appearances
such
as
the
size
of
the
red
queen's
head
or
alice's
height

supervisor

cited
the

as
being

it

most
creatively
involved

burton
felt
3d
was
appropriate
to
the
story's
environment[12]
burton
and
zanuck
chose
to
film
with
conventional
cameras
and
convert
the
footage
into
3d
during
postproduction
zanuck
explained
3d
cameras
were
too
expensive
and
clumsy
to
use
and
they
felt
that
there
was
no
difference
between
converted
footage
and
those
shot
in
the
format[56]
james
cameron
who
released
his
3d
film
avatar
in
december&nbsp2009
criticized
the
choice
stating
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
shoot
in
2d
and
convert
to
3d[57]

subversively
witty
brilliantly
cast

appointed
dazzler
that
also
manages
to
hit
all
the
emotionally
satisfying
marks
while
also
praising
its
computergenerated

(cgi)
saying
ultimately
it's
the
visual
landscape
that
makes
alice's
newest
adventure
so
wondrous
as
technology
has
finally
been
able
to
catch
up
with
burton's
endlessly
fertile
imagination[115]

burton's
disneyfied

alice

written

linda
woolverton
is
a
strange
brew
indeed
murky
diffuse
and
meandering
set
not
in
a
wonderland
that
pops
with
demented
life
but
in
a
world
called
underland
that's
like
a
joyless
bombedout
version
of

it
looks
like
a
cgi
head
