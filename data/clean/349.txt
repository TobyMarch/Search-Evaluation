parents
need

that
this
classic
1908
children's
novel
by
lm
montomgery
remains
a
perennial
favorite
thanks
to
its
memorable
heroine
irrepressible
redheaded
orphan
anne
shirley
anne's
adventures
are
full
of
amusing
(and
occasionally
mildly
dangerous)
scrapes
but
she's
quick
to
learn
from
her
mistakes
and
usually
has
only
the
best
of
intentions
although
anne
gets
her
best
friend
drunk
in
one
episode
(it's
an
honest
mistake)
there's
very
little
here
that's
at
all
iffy
for
kids

though
younger
readers
might
get
a
bit
bogged
down
in
the
many
descriptions
of
anne's
prince
edward
island
canada
home
a
sad
death
may
hit
some
kids
hard
but
the
book's
messages
about
the
importance
of
love
friendship
family
and
ambition
are
worth
it
educational
value2
kids
will
learn
about
daytoday
life
in
late1800s
canada
from
cooking
and
cleaning
tasks
to
farm
chores
there
are
also
worthwhile
lessons
about
friendship
honesty
and
family
positive
messages5
the
book
celebrates
imagination
creativity
friendship
community
and
embracing
family
wherever
you
happen
to
find
it
characters
learn
lessons
from
their
mistakes
and
anne
especially
tries
to
improve
herself
when
her
flaws
are
pointed
out
positive
role
models5
anne
is
the
poster
girl
for
learning
from
your
mistakes

her
impulsiveness
and
enthusiasm
lead
her
into
scrapes
of
all
kinds
but
she
usually
means
well
and
is
quick
(in
most
cases)
to
make
amends
though
she
can
also
hold
a
grudge
she's
also
smart
imaginative
independent
hardworking
and
creative
in
other
words
an
excellent
role
model
for
girls
marilla
and
matthew
are
loving
(if
not
demonstrative)
caregivers
and
they
parent
anne
the
best
way
they
know
how
violence1
a
few
episodes
find
anne
lashing
out
in
anger
or
stuck
in
mildly
perilous
situations

walking
atop
a
roof
for
instance
or
floating
in
a
leaky
boat

but
there's
no
real
violence
or
danger
a
key
character's
death
is
very
sad
references
to
spanking
and
some
corporal
punishment
in
school
which
was
accurate
for
the
time
period
anne
enjoys
tragic
tales
of
woe
and
imagines
many
of
them
sex1
very
mild
flirting
between
some
characters
and
talk
of
beaux
(aka
boyfriends)
a
teacher
pays
special
attention
to
one
of
his
teen
students
(which
is
less
scandalous
in
anne's
time
than
it
would
be
today
but
is
still
a
little
eyebrowraising)

what's
the
story?
when
aging
siblings
marilla
and
mathew
cuthbert
of
avonlea
a
small
town
in
canada's
maritime
province
of
prince
edward
island
decide
to
adopt
an
orphan
boy
to
help
with
their
farm
they
never
expect
to
get
talkative
11yearold
redhead
anne
shirley
instead
anne's
arrival
at
green
gables
immediately
stirs
up
the
cuthberts'
predictable
evenkeeled
lives

and
before
long
they're
so
attached
to
her
that
they
can't
bring
themselves
to
send
her
back
to
the
orphan
asylum
after
all
with
her
vivid
imagination
mileaminute
chatter
and
impulsive
lovestarved
heart
anne
has
an
impact
on
everyone
she
meets
in
avonlea
from
busybody
rachel
lynde
to
bosom
friend
diana
barry
to
handsome
gilbert
blythe
the
boy
who
dares
to
call
anne
carrots
is
it
any
good?
&nbsp
more
than
a
century
after
she
first
beguiled
readers
anne
shirley
is
still
one
of
the
most
beloved
characters
in
children's
literature

and
for
good
reason
you
can't
help
but
be
charmed
by
her
mix
of
chatter
imagination
fierce
loyalty
and
enthusiasm
her
tendency
for
the
dramatic

both
the
dizzying
heights
of
joy
and
the
depths
of
despair

makes
her
relatable
and
sympathetic
and
her
ability
to
see
beauty
in
everything
is
inspiring
montgomery's
knack
for
creating
memorable
characters
and
realistic
dialogue
makes
anne
of
green
gables
extremely
readable
though
reluctant
readers
(or
younger
kids
in
general)
may
balk
at
her
many
descriptions
of
prince
edward
island's
natural
splendors
those
who
are
ready
for
anne's
adventures
though
will
find
her
a
delightful
companion

and
will
be
excited
to
follow
her
through
the
book's
multiple
sequels

you
