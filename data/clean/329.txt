themes
are
the
fundamental
and
often
universal
ideas
explored
in
a
literary
work
alienation
as
a
form
of
selfprotection
throughout
the
novel
holden
seems
to
be
excluded
from
and
victimized
by
the
world
around
him
as
he
says
to
mr
spencer
he
feels
trapped
on
“the
other
side”
of
life
and
he
continually
attempts
to
find
his
way
in
a
world
in
which
he
feels
he
doesn’t
belong
as
the
novel
progresses
we
begin
to
perceive
that
holden’s
alienation
is
his
way
of
protecting
himself
just
as
he
wears
his
hunting
hat
(see
“symbols”
below)
to
advertise
his
uniqueness
he
uses
his
isolation
as
proof
that
he
is
better
than
everyone
else
around
him
and
therefore
above
interacting
with
them
the
truth
is
that
interactions
with
other
people
usually
confuse
and
overwhelm
him
and
his
cynical
sense
of
superiority
serves
as
a
type
of
selfprotection
thus
holden’s
alienation
is
the
source
of
what
little
stability
he
has
in
his
life
as
readers
we
can
see
that
holden’s
alienation
is
the
cause
of
most
of
his
pain
he
never
addresses
his
own
emotions
directly
nor
does
he
attempt
to
discover
the
source
of
his
troubles
he
desperately
needs
human
contact
and
love
but
his
protective
wall
of
bitterness
prevents
him
from
looking
for
such
interaction
alienation
is
both
the
source
of
holden’s
strength
and
the
source
of
his
problems
for
example
his
loneliness
propels
him
into
his
date
with
sally
hayes
but
his
need
for
isolation
causes
him
to
insult
her
and
drive
her
away
similarly
he
longs
for
the
meaningful
connection
he
once
had
with
jane
gallagher
but
he
is
too
frightened
to
make
any
real
effort
to
contact
her
he
depends
upon
his
alienation
but
it
destroys
him
the
painfulness
of
growing
up
according
to
most
analyses
the
catcher
in
the
rye
is
a
bildungsroman
a
novel
about
a
young
character’s
growth
into
maturity
while
it
is
appropriate
to
discuss
the
novel
in
such
terms
holden
caulfield
is
an
unusual
protagonist
for
a
bildungsroman
because
his
central
goal
is
to
resist
the
process
of
maturity
itself
as
his
thoughts
about
the
museum
of
natural
history
demonstrate
holden
fears
change
and
is
overwhelmed
by
complexity
he
wants
everything
to
be
easily
understandable
and
eternally
fixed
like
the
statues
of
eskimos
and
indians
in
the
museum
he
is
frightened
because
he
is
guilty
of
the
sins
he
criticizes
in
others
and
because
he
can’t
understand
everything
around
him
but
he
refuses
to
acknowledge
this
fear
expressing
it
only
in
a
few
instances—for
example
when
he
talks
about
sex
and
admits
that
“[s]ex
is
something
i
just
don’t
understand
i
swear
to
god
i
don’t”
(chapter
9)
instead
of
acknowledging
that
adulthood
scares
and
mystifies
him
holden
invents
a
fantasy
that
adulthood
is
a
world
of
superficiality
and
hypocrisy
(“phoniness”)
while
childhood
is
a
world
of
innocence
curiosity
and
honesty
nothing
reveals
his
image
of
these
two
worlds
better
than
his
fantasy
about
the
catcher
in
the
rye
he
imagines
childhood
as
an
idyllic
field
of
rye
in
which
children
romp
and
play
adulthood
for
the
children
of
this
world
is
equivalent
to
death—a
fatal
fall
over
the
edge
of
a
cliff
his
created
understandings
of
childhood
and
adulthood
allow
holden
to
cut
himself
off
from
the
world
by
covering
himself
with
a
protective
armor
of
cynicism
but
as
the
book
progresses
holden’s
experiences
particularly
his
encounters
with
mr
antolini
and
phoebe
reveal
the
shallowness
of
his
conceptions
the
phoniness
of
the
adult
world
“phoniness”
which
is
probably
the
most
famous
phrase
from
the
catcher
in
the
rye
is
one
of
holden’s
favorite
concepts
it
is
his
catchall
for
describing
the
superficiality
hypocrisy
pretension
and
shallowness
that
he
encounters
in
the
world
around
him
in
chapter
22
just
before
he
reveals
his
fantasy
of
the
catcher
in
the
rye
holden
explains
that
adults
are
inevitably
phonies
and
what’s
worse
they
can’t
see
their
own
phoniness
phoniness
for
holden
stands
as
an
emblem
of
everything
that’s
wrong
in
the
world
around
him
and
provides
an
excuse
for
him
to
withdraw
into
his
cynical
isolation
though
oversimplified
holden’s
observations
are
not
entirely
inaccurate
he
can
be
a
highly
insightful
narrator
and
he
is
very
aware
of
superficial
behavior
in
those
around
him
throughout
the
novel
he
encounters
many
characters
who
do
seem
affected
pretentious
or
superficial—sally
hayes
carl
luce
maurice
and
sunny
and
even
mr
spencer
stand
out
as
examples
some
characters
like
maurice
and
sunny
are
genuinely
harmful
but
although
holden
expends
so
much
energy
searching
for
phoniness
in
others
he
never
directly
observes
his
own
phoniness
his
deceptions
are
generally
pointless
and
cruel
and
he
notes
that
he
is
a
compulsive
liar
for
example
on
the
train
to
new
york
he
perpetrates
a
meanspirited
and
needless
prank
on
mrs
morrow
he’d
like
us
to
believe
that
he
is
a
paragon
of
virtue
in
a
world
of
phoniness
but
that
simply
isn’t
the
case
although
he’d
like
to
believe
that
the
world
is
a
simple
place
and
that
virtue
and
innocence
rest
on
one
side
of
the
fence
while
superficiality
and
phoniness
rest
on
the
other
holden
is
his
own
counterevidence
the
world
is
not
as
simple
as
he’d
like—and
needs—it
to
be
even
he
cannot
adhere
to
the
same
blackandwhite
standards
with
which
he
judges
other
people
motifs
motifs
are
recurring
structures
contrasts
and
literary
devices
that
can
help
to
develop
and
inform
the
text’s
major
themes
loneliness
holden’s
loneliness
a
more
concrete
manifestation
of
his
alienation
problem
is
a
driving
force
throughout
the
book
most
of
the
novel
describes
his
almost
manic
quest
for
companionship
as
he
flits
from
one
meaningless
encounter
to
another
yet
while
his
behavior
indicates
his
loneliness
holden
consistently
shies
away
from
introspection
and
thus
doesn’t
really
know
why
he
keeps
behaving
as
he
does
because
holden
depends
on
his
isolation
to
preserve
his
detachment
from
the
world
and
to
maintain
a
level
of
selfprotection
he
often
sabotages
his
own
attempts
to
end
his
loneliness
for
example
his
conversation
with
carl
luce
and
his
date
with
sally
hayes
are
made
unbearable
by
his
rude
behavior
his
calls
to
jane
gallagher
are
aborted
for
a
similar
reason
to
protect
his
precious
and
fragile
sense
of
individuality
loneliness
is
the
emotional
manifestation
of
the
alienation
holden
experiences
it
is
both
a
source
of
great
pain
and
a
source
of
his
security
relationships
intimacy
and
sexuality
relationships
intimacy
and
sexuality
are
also
recurring
motifs
relating
to
the
larger
theme
of
alienation
both
physical
and
emotional
relationships
offer
holden
opportunity
to
break
out
of
his
isolated
shell
they
also
represent
what
he
fears
most
about
the
adult
world
complexity
unpredictability
and
potential
for
conflict
and
change
as
he
demonstrates
at
the
museum
of
natural
history
holden
likes
the
world
to
be
silent
and
frozen
predictable
and
unchanging
as
he
watches
phoebe
sleep
holden
projects
his
own
idealizations
of
childhood
onto
her
but
in
realworld
relationships
people
talk
back
and
phoebe
reveals
how
different
her
childhood
is
from
holden’s
romanticized
notion
because
people
are
unpredictable
they
challenge
holden
and
force
him
to
question
his
senses
of
selfconfidence
and
selfworth
for
intricate
and
unspoken
reasons
seemingly
stemming
from
allie’s
death
holden
has
trouble
dealing
with
this
kind
of
complexity
as
a
result
he
has
isolated
himself
and
fears
intimacy
although
he
encounters
opportunities
for
both
physical
and
emotional
intimacy
he
bungles
them
all
wrapping
himself
in
a
psychological
armor
of
critical
cynicism
and
bitterness
even
so
holden
desperately
continues
searching
for
new
relationships
always
undoing
himself
only
at
the
last
moment
lying
and
deception
lying
and
deception
are
the
most
obvious
and
hurtful
elements
of
the
larger
category
of
phoniness
holden’s
definition
of
phoniness
relies
mostly
on
a
kind
of
selfdeception
he
seems
to
reserve
the
most
scorn
for
people
who
think
that
they
are
something
they
are
not
or
who
refuse
to
acknowledge
their
own
weaknesses
but
lying
to
others
is
also
a
kind
of
phoniness
a
type
of
deception
that
indicates
insensitivity
callousness
or
even
cruelty
of
course
holden
himself
is
guilty
of
both
these
crimes
his
random
and
repeated
lying
highlights
his
own
selfdeception—he
refuses
to
acknowledge
his
own
shortcomings
and
is
unwilling
to
consider
how
his
behavior
affects
those
around
him
through
his
lying
and
deception
holden
proves
that
he
is
just
as
guilty
of
phoniness
as
the
people
he
criticizes
symbols
symbols
are
objects
characters
figures
and
colors
used
to
represent
abstract
ideas
or
concepts
the
“catcher
in
the
rye”
as
the
source
of
the
book’s
title
this
symbol
merits
close
inspection
it
first
appears
in
chapter
16
when
a
kid
holden
admires
for
walking
in
the
street
rather
than
on
the
sidewalk
is
singing
the
robert
burns
song
“comin’
thro’
the
rye”
in
chapter
22
when
phoebe
asks
holden
what
he
wants
to
do
with
his
life
he
replies
with
his
image
from
the
song
of
a
“catcher
in
the
rye”
holden
imagines
a
field
of
rye
perched
high
on
a
cliff
full
of
children
romping
and
playing
he
says
he
would
like
to
protect
the
children
from
falling
off
the
edge
of
the
cliff
by
“catching”
them
if
they
were
on
the
verge
of
tumbling
over
as
phoebe
points
out
holden
has
misheard
the
lyric
he
thinks
the
line
is
“if
a
body
catch
a
body
comin’
through
the
rye”
but
the
actual
lyric
is
“if
a
body
meet
a
body
coming
through
the
rye”
the
song
“comin’
thro’
the
rye”
asks
if
it
is
wrong
for
two
people
to
have
a
romantic
encounter
out
in
the
fields
away
from
the
public
eye
even
if
they
don’t
plan
to
have
a
commitment
to
one
another
it
is
highly
ironic
that
the
word
“meet”
refers
to
an
encounter
that
leads
to
recreational
sex
because
the
word
that
holden
substitutes—“catch”—takes
on
the
exact
opposite
meaning
in
his
mind
holden
wants
to
catch
children
before
they
fall
out
of
innocence
into
knowledge
of
the
adult
world
including
knowledge
of
sex
holden’s
red
hunting
hat
the
red
hunting
hat
is
one
of
the
most
recognizable
symbols
from
twentiethcentury
american
literature
it
is
inseparable
from
our
image
of
holden
with
good
reason
it
is
a
symbol
of
his
uniqueness
and
individuality
the
hat
is
outlandish
and
it
shows
that
holden
desires
to
be
different
from
everyone
around
him
at
the
same
time
he
is
very
selfconscious
about
the
hat—he
always
mentions
when
he
is
wearing
it
and
he
often
doesn’t
wear
it
if
he
is
going
to
be
around
people
he
knows
the
presence
of
the
hat
therefore
mirrors
the
central
conflict
in
the
book
holden’s
need
for
isolation
versus
his
need
for
companionship
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
hat’s
color
red
is
the
same
as
that
of
allie’s
and
phoebe’s
hair
perhaps
holden
associates
it
with
the
innocence
and
purity
he
believes
these
characters
represent
and
wears
it
as
a
way
to
connect
to
them
he
never
explicitly
comments
on
the
hat’s
significance
other
than
to
mention
its
unusual
appearance
the
museum
of
natural
history
holden
tells
us
the
symbolic
meaning
of
the
museum’s
displays
they
appeal
to
him
because
they
are
frozen
and
unchanging
he
also
mentions
that
he
is
troubled
by
the
fact
that
he
has
changed
every
time
he
returns
to
them
the
museum
represents
the
world
holden
wishes
he
could
live
in
it’s
the
world
of
his
“catcher
in
the
rye”
fantasy
a
world
where
nothing
ever
changes
where
everything
is
simple
understandable
and
infinite
holden
is
terrified
by
the
unpredictable
challenges
of
the
world—he
hates
conflict
he
is
confused
by
allie’s
senseless
death
and
he
fears
interaction
with
other
people
the
ducks
in
the
central
park
lagoon
holden’s
curiosity
about
where
the
ducks
go
during
the
winter
reveals
a
genuine
more
youthful
side
to
his
character
for
most
of
the
book
he
sounds
like
a
grumpy
old
man
who
is
angry
at
the
world
but
his
search
for
the
ducks
represents
the
curiosity
of
youth
and
a
joyful
willingness
to
encounter
the
mysteries
of
the
world
it
is
a
memorable
moment
because
holden
clearly
lacks
such
willingness
in
other
aspects
of
his
life
the
ducks
and
their
pond
are
symbolic
in
several
ways
their
mysterious
perseverance
in
the
face
of
an
inhospitable
environment
resonates
with
holden’s
understanding
of
his
own
situation
in
addition
the
ducks
prove
that
some
vanishings
are
only
temporary
traumatized
and
made
acutely
aware
of
the
fragility
of
life
by
his
brother
allie’s
death
holden
is
terrified
by
the
idea
of
change
and
disappearance
the
ducks
vanish
every
winter
but
they
return
every
spring
thus
symbolizing
change
that
isn’t
permanent
but
cyclical
finally
the
pond
itself
becomes
a
minor
metaphor
for
the
world
as
holden
sees
it
because
it
is
“partly
frozen
and
partly
not
frozen”
the
pond
is
in
transition
between
two
states

rye

'the
song
“comin’
thro’
the
rye”
asks
if
it
is
wrong
for
two
people
to
have
a
romantic
encounter
out
in
the
fields
away
from
the
public
eye
even
if
they
don’t
plan
to
have
a
commitment
to
one
another'
i
thought
the
'rye'
referred
to
in
robert
burns'
poem
was
the
river
rye
hence
the
lines
'jenny's
a
wet
poor
body
jenny's
seldom
dry'
in
this
regard
it
is
about
two
people
who
meet
at
a
river
with
no
crossing
which
will
cause
people
to
question
why
one
of
them
is
wet
and
what
they
have
been
doing

useful
for
many
papers
and
is
a
very
important
quotation!
chapter

(towards
the
end)
the
thing
with
kids
is
if
they
want
to
grab
for
the
gold
ring
you
have
to
let
them
do
it
and
not
say
anything
if
they
fall
off
they
fall
off
but
it's
bad
if
you
say
anything
to
them
this
occurs
while

remember
that
this
is
a
sexuallythemed
poem
when
burns
says
that
jenny
is
rarely
dry
he
is
referring
to
her
vaginal
lubrication
jenny
is
sexually
active
so
her
genitals
are
seldom
