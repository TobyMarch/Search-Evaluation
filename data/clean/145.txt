“we’ve
been
beatles
for
a
long
time”
john
lennon
tells
me
at
the
bar
in
the
prince
of
wales
theatre
“ever
since
i
was
a
small
boy
i’ve
been
studying
for
this
job”
john
short
and
tanned
with
dark
hair
and
a
hint
of
eyeliner
does
not
look
much
like
lennon
because
he
isn't
the
john
lennon
reclining
in
a
chair
is
michael
gagliano
breaking
from
a
rehearsal
for
new
beatles
musical
let
it
be
from
tonight
gagliano
must
become
a
living
lennon
for
two
and
a
half
hours
as
part
of
the
cast
of
the
musical
which
follows
the
beatles’
music
from
‘love
me
do’
in
1962
to
their
breakup
in
1970
those
involved
in
let
it
be
aren’t
attempting
to
rewrite
the
story
of
the
beatles
and
have
opted
instead
for
a
hyperprecise
tribute
all
songs
and
and
no
dialogue
that
they
hope
will
emulate
the
look
and
sound
of
their
heroes
well
enough
for
the
audience
to
believe
they
are
watching
the
liverpool
lads
with
the
sixties
in
full
swing
it
is
a
gamble
almost
none
of
the
cast
look
like
their
corresponding
beatles
and
they
range
from
a
ringo
fresh
out
of
music
college
to
pauls

40

a
hard
day's
night
performed
by
the
cast
of
let
it
be
emanuele
angeletti
a
former
italian
xfactor
contestant
who
plays
an
amiable
paul
mccartney
came
to
john
and
paul
separately
while
growing
up
near
rome
“i
liked
paul
mccartney
so
much
ebony
and
ivory
with
stevie
wonder
which
i
listened
to
every
day
and
beautiful
boy
by
john
lennon
and
one
day
my
father
told
me
‘there
is
a
band
where
paul
and
john
sing
things
together
they’re
called
the
beatles’
i
didn’t
know!”
angeletti
formed
a
band
then
joined
a
beatles
band
and
has
never
stopped
trying
to
be
the
perfect
mccartney
“i’ve
played
beatles
for
fifteen
years
in
italy
in
a
tribute
band
a
lot
of
gigs
and
tv
programmes”
he
says
after
auditioning
with
his
band
in
london
for
let
it
be
he
was
the
only
one
chosen
for
a
part
angeletti’s
spoken
english
is
heavily
accented
but
his
singing
voice
is
unbelievably
close
to
the
subtle
but
distinctive
quality
of
mccartney’s
vocals
his
fellow
paul
james
fox
had
an
equally
unlikely
journey
to
the
london
stage
singing
for
soldiers
in
afghanistan
and
iraq
armed
with
just
an
acoustic
guitar
and
a
catalogue
of
beatles
hits
in
his
head
“i’ve
entertained
the
troops
for
ten
years”
he
says
“i
just
stand
there
with
an
acoustic
guitar
and
you’d
be
amazed
that
guys
at
the
age
of
the
18
even
though
when
they
were
born
the
beatles
had
long
disbanded
there’s
not
one
night
that
you
don’t
get
a
request
thrown
at
you
for
helter
skelter
the
beatles
never
fail
to
get
a
mention”
each
member
of
the
cast
has
a
moment
they
recall
as
irrevocably
converting
them
to
the
way
and
light
of
the
beatles
for
stephen
hill
a
george
harrison
with
the
hair
and
boyish
features
that
make
him
the
sole
cast
member
who
might
be
mistaken
for
his
guitarist
twin
it
was
help!
he
says
“hearing
help!
is
like
being
punched
in
the
face
with
music
for
me
in
a
good
way
help!
what’s
that?
within
five
seconds
you
know
what
that
song
is
“it’s
got
to
be
right
what
we’re
aiming
for
is
for
people
to
say
‘i’ve
just
seen
the
beatles’
as
extreme
as
that
may
sound”
the
beatles
performing
at
the
royal
variety
show
in
1963
in
the
same
theatre
as
let
it
be
is
staged
it
seems
fitting
that
the
refurbished
cavern
club
in
liverpool
was
the
audition
venue
that
produced
this
refurbished
george
harrison
“the
whole
reason
i
play
guitar
is
because
i
have
family
in
liverpool
i
visited
them
aged
eight
and
discovered
the
beatles
he
says
“everybody
starts
out
wanting
to
be
in
a
band
then
you
get
into
the
beatles
and
you
find
out
there’s
a
whole
scene
of
beatles
bands
it’s
just
a
case
of
playing
lead
guitar
anyway
so
the
natural
choice
was
george
and
luckily
he’s
my
favourite
beatle
anyway”
back
at
the
bar
with
not
one
but
two
john
lennons
reuven
gershon
explains
why
he
wanted
to
be
a
beatle
rather
than
play
his
own
songs
or
those
of
any
other
rock
band
for
that
matter
“i
love
the
beatles
music
but
luckily
i’m
able
to
impersonate
one
of
the
beatles
i’m
not
black
and
i
can’t
play
guitar
like
jimi
hendrix
so
i
can’t
do
that
though
i
would
if
i
could
one
of
the
things
i
love
the
most
is
that
i
can
play
and
sing
like
john
lennon
and
i’m
just
happy
to
be
able
to
do
that”
michael
gagliano
sees
let
it
be
as
the
pinnacle
of
what
is
possible
for
a
beatles
obsessive
“the
beatles
bands
are
like
any
other
industry
there’s
different
levels
of
competence
and
of
abilities
you
start
off
and
it’s
like
a
ladder
the
better
you
get
the
better
band
you
join
and
the
better
the
people
are
you
play
with”
after
all
he
says
“this
is
the
biggest
beatles
job
on
the
planet”
