because
of
the
dangers
of
world
war
ii
the
four
pevensie
children
were
sent
away
from
london
to
the
home
of
professor
digory
kirke
who
lived
in
a
large
old
house
with
many
rooms
useful
for
hiding
and
exploration
while
exploring
the
house
with
her
siblings
lucy
decided
to
investigate
an
old
wardrobe
she
found
in
one
of
the
remote
rooms
upon
entering
the
wardrobe
lucy
found
herself
walking
through
trees
rather
than
the
expected
coats
she
pressed
on
and
found
herself
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
snowy
wood
next
to
a
lamppost
where
she
met
tumnus
the
faun
who
invited
her
to
his
home
for
tea
he
later
told
her
that
he
had
intended
to
hand
her
over
to
the
white
witch
the
usurping
queen
of
narnia
the
faun
feeling
guilty
for
what
he
had
planned
to
do
helped
lucy
find
her
way
back
to
the
wardrobe
despite
the
risk
that
the
white
witch
would
find
him
out
and
punish
him
later
lucy
tried
to
tell
her
siblings
about
the
strange
land
she
had
found
but
they
did
not
believe
her
during
a
game
of
hideandseek
lucy
returned
to
the
country
in
the
wardrobe
and
edmund
followed
her
so
he
could
go
on
teasing
her
about
her
imaginary
country
although
he
denied
it
when
the
older
children
asked
him
soon
all
four
of
them
had
gone
into
the
wardrobe
and
seen
narnia
susan
the
most
sensible
of
them
wanted
to
return
home
but
lucy
convinced
peter
that
they
needed
to
help
her
new
friend
mr
tumnus
who
was
arrested
the
prophecy
edit
down
at
cair
paravel
there
are
four
thrones
and
it's
a
saying
in
narnia
time
out
of
mind
that
when
two
sons
of
adam
and
two
daughters
of
eve
sit
on
those
four
thrones
then
it
will
be
the
end
only
of
the
white
witch's
reign
but
of
her
life
―mr
beaver[src]
the
four
children
were
soon
found
by
mr
beaver
who
took
them
home
introduced
them
to
his
wife
mrs
beaver
and
they
had
dinner
he
told
them
of
aslan
the
great
lion
and
a
prophecy
that
said
when
two
sons
of
adam
and
two
daughters
of
eve
sat
upon
the
four
thrones
at
cair
paravel
all
narnia
would
be
put
to
rights
while
they
were
talking
they
found
out
that
edmund
had
slipped
away
and
they
decided
to
flee
after
realizing
that
he
would
tell
where
they
were
to
the
white
witch
on
their
journey
they
met
father
christmas
who
gave
lucy
a
cordial
made
from
the
juice
of
fireflowers
that
would
heal
others
with
a
single
drop
and
a
dagger
and
gave
susan
bow
and
arrows
and
a
horn
which
could
bring
help
whenever
it
was
blown
and
peter
a
sword
and
a
shield
later
while
susan
and
lucy
were
having
fun
in
the
woods
two
wolves
attacked
them
susan
called
for
help
with
her
horn
and
peter
and
aslan
came
to
their
rescue
peter
killed
maugrim
one
of
the
wolves
in
his
first
fight
and
aslan
let
the
other
wolf
go
followed
by
centaurs
and
eagles
from
aslan's
army
that
wolf
led
them
right
to
edmund
whom
they
rescued
later
the
witch
requested
an
audience
with
aslan
there
she
claimed
that
since
edmund
was
a
traitor
according
to
the
deep
magic
his
blood
belonged
to
her
eventually
they
went
inside
the
tent
where
they
reached
an
agreement
that
she
would
kill
him
later
that
night
but
renounce
her
claim
on
edmund
aslan
eventually
went
though
without
telling
anyone
however
lucy
and
susan
saw
him
leaving
and
followed
there
they
saw
aslan
being
killed
after
which
the
witch's
army
left
in
the
morning
just
as
they
were
about
to
leave
they
heard
the
stone
table
crack
when
they
turned
around
to
look
they
saw
aslan
standing
before
them
who
revealed
to
them
the
deeper
magic
from
before
the
dawn
of
time
stated
that
when
a
willing
victim
is
killed
in
a
traitor's
stead
the
table
would
crack
and
even
death
would
start
working
backwards
afterwards
they
went
to
the
witch's
castle
and
revived
all
the
statues
lucy
found
mr
tumnus
begged
aslan
to
revive
him
and
soon
afterward
she
and
the
revived
faun
were
dancing
happily
then
they
joined
the
battle
between
aslan's
army
and
the
witch's
