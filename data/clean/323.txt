the
catcher
in
the
rye
plot
summary
the
catcher
in
the
rye
is
the
story
of
teenager
holden
caulfield's
turbulent
last
few
days
before
his
christmas
vacation
during
these
days
holden
leaves
pencey
prep
a
boys'
school
he's
been
kicked
out
of
and
takes
off
for
a
few
nights
alone
in
new
york
city
holden
tells
the
story
as
a
monologue
from
some
sort
of
a
mental
facility
where
he's
recovering
from
the
stress
of
the
experiences
he
retells
holden's
tale
begins
at
pencey
which
he
despises
for
its
prevailing
phoniness
holden
finds
a
lot
of
people
and
attitudes
unbearably
phony
it's
the
day
of
the
big
pencey
football
game
something
that
holden
has
little
interest
in
in
lieu
of
watching
holden
takes
a
walk
to
the
house
of
his
history
teacher
old
mr
spencer
this
isn't
a
particularly
satisfying
visit
nor
is
his
last
evening
at
pencey
during
which
he
hangs
around
with
a
coarse
and
dull
guy
named
ackley
and
later
gets
beat
up
by
his
own
roommate
a
ladies'
man
named
stradlater
the
idea
of
stradlater
taking
one
of
holden's
old
friends
jane
gallagher
out
on
a
date
and
the
thought
of
suave
stradlater
making
the
moves
on
his
innocent
friend
drives
holden
to
his
fists
after
the
fight
holden
decides
to
get
up
and
leave
pencey
immediately
he
finishes
packing
and
leaves
campus
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
train
takes
holden
to
new
york
city
where
his
family
has
lived
all
his
life
here
he
checks
into
the
derelict
edmont
hotel
a
place
that
provides
him
with
several
adventures
including
an
evening
dancing
with
three
dull
tourist
girls
and
a
clumsy
encounter
with
a
prostitute
holden
sends
the
prostitute
away
without
services
rendered
and
although
he
pays
her
for
her
time
it's
apparently
not
enough
for
this
holden
gets
his
second
pummeling
in
as
many
nights
at
the
hands
of
maurice
the
hotel's
elevator
man/pimp
holden
spends
a
total
of
two
days
in
the
city
and
these
days
are
largely
characterized
by
drunkenness
and
loneliness
he
meets
up
with
an
old
acquaintance
named
carl
luce
and
has
a
date
with
an
offandon
girlfriend
sally
hayes
but
both
experiences
leave
him
more
miserable
than
before
finally
holden
sneaks
into
his
parents'
apartment
to
visit
his
kid
sister
phoebe
who's
about
the
only
person
he
seems
to
be
able
to
communicate
with
after
this
holden
feels
a
little
better
and
he
heads
off
to
the
apartment
of
his
exenglish
teacher
mr
antolini
the
comfort
holden
hopes
to
find
there
is
upset
when
he
wakes
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
find
mr
antolini
petting
his
head
in
a
way
that
seems
perverty
after
this
holden
gets
awfully
depressed
his
distress
with
the
phoniness
and
stupidity
of
the
world
focuses
as
he
spends
his
last
afternoon
wandering
around
the
city
what
bothers
him
most
is
that
the
world
seems
to
have
no
sanctuary
from
the
phony
or
perverse
in
it
anymoreit's
a
cruel
place
to
grow
up
this
becomes
all
the
more
real
for
holden
as
he
wanders
around
his
little
sister's
school
building
and
keeps
finding
swear
words
scribbled
on
the
walls
holden
begins
to
envision
himself
as
a
guardian
of
children
someone
who
will
protect
their
innocence
this
hope
is
crystallized
in
a
vision
of
himself
as
the
catcher
in
the
ryea
sort
of
guard
at
the
edges
of
a
field
where
children
can
run
free
and
play
a
guardian
who
can
keep
these
kids
from
falling
in
their
exuberance
over
the
field's
edges
though
holden
tells
his
little
sister
he's
going
to
move
out
west
this
doesn't
pan
out
instead
after
a
little
fight
with
phoebe
holden
ends
up
accompanying
her
to
the
park
and
watching
as
she
rides
the
merrygoround
stretching
from
her
wooden
horse
to
reach
a
prized
brass
ring
as
he
watches
with
a
combination
of
fear
and
joy
holden
seems
to
have
decided
that
there
can
be
no
catcher
that
all
you
can
do
is
hope
kids
develop
in
the
harsh
world
on
their
own
holden
never
does
give
a
thorough
assessment
of
his
prognosis
since
his
hospitalization
but
if
his
voice
in
the
novel's
last
few
pages
is
any
indication
his
time
recovering
has
left
him
calmer
and
with
more
perspective
but
still
lonely
and
without
direction
