and
1960s
at
the
same
time
both
andersson
and
ulvaeus
worked
on
projects
with
their
respective
girlfriends
ulvaeus
had
become
involved
with
vocalist
agnetha
faltskog
a
performer
with
a
recent
number
one
swedish
hit
i
was
so
in
love
under
her
belt
while
andersson
began
seeing

massive
international
hit
with
people
need
love

success

an
invitation
to
enter

swedish

1973
eurovision
song
contest
where
under
the
unwieldy
name
of
bjorn
benny
agnetha

frida
they
submitted
ring
ring
which
proved
extremely
popular
with
audiences
but
placed
only
third
in
the
judges'
ballots
the
next
year
rechristened
abba
(a
suggestion
from
stig
anderson
and
an
acronym
of
the
members'
first
names)
the
quartet
submitted
the
single
waterloo
and
became
the
first
swedish
act
to
win
the
eurovision
competition
the
record
proved
to
be
the
first
of
many
international
hits
although
the
group
hit
a
slump
after
their
initial
success
as
subsequent
singles
failed
to
chart
in
1975
however
abba
issued
sos
a
smash
not
only
in
america
and
britain
but
also
in
nonenglish
speaking
countries
such
as
spain
germany
and
the
benelux
nations
where
the
group's
success
was
fairly
unprecedented
a
string
of
hits
followed
including
mamma
mia
fernando
and
dancing
queen
(abba's
sole
us
charttopper)
further
honing
their
lush
buoyant
sound
by
the
spring
of
1976
they
were
already
in
position
to
issue
their
first
greatest
hits
collection
abba's
popularity
continued
in
1977
when
both
knowing
me
knowing
you
and
the
name
of
the
game
dominated
airwaves
the
group
also
starred
in
the
feature
film
abba

the
movie
which
was
released
in
1978
that
year
andersson
and
lyngstad
married
as
had
ulvaeus
and
faltskog
in
1971
although
the
latter
couple
separated
a
few
months
later
in
fact
romantic
suffering
was
the
subject
of
many
songs
on
the
quartet's
next
lp
1979's
voulezvous
shortly
after
the
release
of
1980s
super
trouper
andersson
and
lyngstad
divorced
as
well
further
straining
the
group
dynamic
the
visitors
issued
the
following
year
was
the
final
lp
of
new
abba
material
and
the
foursome
officially
disbanded
after
the
december
1982
release
of
their
single
under
attack
although
all
of
the
group's
members
soon
embarked
on
new
projects

both
lyngstad
and
faltskog
issued
solo
lps
while
andersson
and
ulvaeus
collaborated
with
tim
rice
on
the
musical
chess

none
proved
as
successful
as
the
group's
earlier
work
largely
because
throughout
much
of
the
world
especially
europe
and
australia
the
abba
phenomenon
never
went
away
repackaged
hits
compilations
and
live
collections
continued
hitting
the
charts
long
after
the
group's
demise
and
new
artists
regularly
pointed
to
the
quartet's
inspiration
while
the
british
dance
duo
erasure
released
a
covers
collection
abbaesque
an
australian
group
called
bjorn
again
found
success
as
abba
impersonators
in
1993
dancing
queen
became
a
staple
of
u2's
zoo
tv
tour

andersson
and
ulvaeus
even
joined
the
irish
superstars
onstage
in
stockholm

while
the
1995
feature
muriel's
wedding
which
won
acclaim
for
its
depiction
of
a
lonely
australian
girl
who
seeks
refuge
in
abba's

bring
the
group's
work
to
the
attention
