led
zeppelin
is
the
most
mystifying
band
in
all
of
rock
and
roll
unlike
the
beatles
rolling
stones
the
who
dylan
u2
or
any
of
the
other
great
mega
acts
they
kept
mostly
to
themselves
and
away
from
the
media
they
usually
did
not
release
singles
and
they
only
really
spoke
out
about
themselves
during
performances
despite
this
they
are
also
the
most
popular
hard
rock
band
ever
like
any
other
great
artist
they
have
more
than
15
great
songs
many
hard
cuts
had
to
be
made
(i
still
don’t
know
how
i
was
able
to
cut
“going
to
california”
“immigrant
song”
“heartbreaker”
and
several
others)
however
here
are
my

no
quarter
“no
quarter”
is
a
gloomy
foray
into
prog
rock
the
vocals
are
very
low
for
plant
possibly
due
to
slowing
down
the
tape
the
lyrics
tend
to
lean
slightly
towards
the
strange
referring
to
the
god
thor
and
by
the
title
to
pirates
live
this
song
was
a
spotlight
for
the
keyboard
playing
of
john
paul
jones

babe
i’m
gonna
leave
you
the
earliest
example
of
the
famed
zeppelin
“light
and
shade”
dynamic
this
song
is
actually
a
cover
“babe
i’m
gonna
leave
you”
was
originally
written
by
anne
bredon
although
the
band
initially
thought
they
were
covering
a
joan
baez
song
a
great
performance
of
this
song
can
be
seen
on
the
2003
selftitled
dvd
in
the
extra
features

dazed
and
confused
“dazed
and
confused”
is
the
famed
centerpiece
of
led
zeppelin’s
debut
album
the
bass
line
is
one
of
the
most
recognizable
in
all
of
rock
the
original
is
by
a
songwriter
named
jake
holmes
who
upon
hearing
zeppelin’s
version
is
said
to
have
declared
“let
them
have
it”
the
song
was
a
guitar
workout
live
stretching
the
song
to
near
30
minutes
12
communication
breakdown
one
of
the
only
zeppelin
songs
that
could
ever
be
deemed
punk
the
song
is
structured
to
go
from
riff
to
blues
progression
back
to
riff
and
repeat
thus
creating
the
formula
for
the
riff
rock
of
the
seventies
the
song
is
one
of
the
first
that
the
band
made
a
video
for
and
also
one
of
the
last
11
over
the
hills
and
far
away
after
the
success
of
their
first
four
albums
zeppelin
was
trying
to
experiment
with
their
sound
so
that
it
wouldn’t
become
a
routine
no
where
is
that
more
evident
than
on
“over
the
hills
and
far
away”
which
is
one
of
the
songs
on
houses
of
the
holy
that
is
intended
as
a
“riff”
song
but
is
different
than
any
of
their
previous
riffs
the
riff
is
more
elaborate
and
is
changed
slightly
from
time
to
time
during
the
song
to
keep
it
fresh
10
how
many
more
times
one
of
the
best
jam
songs
ever
recorded
“how
many
more
times”
has
another
great
bass
line
from
john
paul
jones
and
goes
places
most
bands
would
not
have
dared
to
go
on
record
in
1969
the
song
is
actually
a
combination
of
several
blues
bits
including
albert
king’s
“the
hunter”
and
howlin’
wolf’s
“how
many
more
years”
9
achilles
last
stand
one
of
the
most
metal
moments
the
band
ever
committed
to
tape
(although
the
band
would
never
admit
to
being
a
part
of
metal)
the
song
is
a
great
showcase
for
all
members
of
the
band
the
machine
gun
drums
the
driving
bass
the
sharp
guitar
and
the
powerful
vocals
all
come
together
to
create
one
of
the
last
truly
great
songs
of
zeppelin’s
career
this
is
rumored
to
be
jimmy
page’s
favorite
zeppelin
song
8
whole
lotta
love
technically
“whole
lotta
love”
is
the
biggest
hit
of
zeppelin’s
career
(although
now
that
the
band
has
gone
digital
it
could
be
overtaken
by
downloads
but
this
has
yet
to
happen)
the
song
is
certainly
one
of
the
band’s
best
songs
and
is
arguably
the
greatest/most
memorable
riffs
of
all
time
7
since
i’ve
been
loving
you
probably
the
best
showcase
of
robert
plant’s
early
vocals
“since
i’ve
been
loving
you”
is
the
epic
composition
the
band
recorded
for
its
third
album
the
guitar
solo
is
the
real
gem
here
which
according
to
rock
lore
was
improvised
in
the
studio
the
song
is
even
better
live
and
i
would
recommend
those
interested
have
a
listen
to
the
version
on
“how
the
west
was
won”
6
that’s
the
way
the
song
sticks
out
in
the
zeppelin
catalog
despite
the
fact
john
bonham
doesn’t
play
on
it
the
lyrics
are
some
of
plant’s
best
and
they
delve
into
such
issues
as
racism
and
childhood
friendship
this
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
acoustic
pieces
the
band
ever
recorded
and
was
always
great
live
5
black
dog
this
is
the
riff
that
was
once
called
“the
dirtiest
sexiest
riff
around”
who
was
this
commentator?
none
other
than
slash
of
guns
n’
roses
fame
who
might
just
know
a
thing
or
two
about
great
riffs
the
song
is
one
of
the
more
complicated
riffs
in
the
band’s
catalog
and
surprisingly
is
not
written
by
jimmy
page
(although
he
still
had
a
hand
in
writing
the
song
as
a
whole)
the
riffs
author
was
actually
john
paul
jones
who
wrote
the
riff
after
listening
to
muddy
waters’
electric
mud
lp
4
kashmir
often
championed
as
the
band’s
greatest
epic
song
by
both
fans
and
robert
plant
himself
“kashmir”
is
truly
literally
epic
the
riff
is
carried
not
only
by
guitar
but
by
an
orchestra
and
the
song
feels
both
like
an
eastern
piece
and
something
a
super
villain
would
have
as
his
theme
the
lyrics
are
great
and
refer
to
a
trip
robert
and
jimmy
made
to
kashmir
(a
trip
that
ended
before
they
reached
their
destination)
3
stairway
to
heaven
the
most
lauded
piece
in
all
of
rock
music
“stairway
to
heaven”
is
both
the
most
beloved
and
hated
song
ever
written
for
some
the
song
is
the
most
beautiful
and
moving
piece
of
music
they’ve
ever
heard
while
others
cringe
at
the
thought
of
hearing
it
the
fact
is
while
it
is
not
necessarily
the
best
song
ever
written
it’s
up
there
the
lyrics
are
brilliant
referring
both
to
the
greed
of
people
while
taking
an
optimistic
perspective
oh
and
that
guitar
solo
is
pretty
good
too
2
ten
years
gone
a
song
about
a
love
gone
bad
which
seemingly
has
no
business
being
on
a
zeppelin
record
as
it’s
so
melodic
and
mellow
that
it
contrasts
with
what
most
people
associate
with
the
band
the
fact
is
that
zeppelin
always
had
many
great
melodic
pieces
and
none
are
more
moving
than
this
one
another
case
of
great
guitar
great
rhythm
section
and
great
lyrics
and
vocals
1
when
the
levee
breaks
“when
the
levee
breaks”
is
a
big
slice
of
apocalyptic
blues
the
song
is
often
miscredited
as
a
cover
of
a
song
by
memphis
minnie
while
the
song
does
borrow
some
lines
from
that
song
those
lines
are
rearranged
and
combined
with
new
lyrical
verses
and
the
music
is
entirely
different
the
song
contains
the
definitive
drum
sample
of
john
bonham
a
sample
that
was
used
throughout
the
following
decades
most
notably
by
the
beastie

guysmileyy

thoughts

scott
great
list
but
it
should
have
been
a
top
50
or
something
smac
you
put
all
my
favorites
on
there
–
“when
the
levee
breaks”
“over
the
hills
and
far
away”
“kashmir”
“babe
i’m
gonna
leave
you”
“black
dog”
well
done
jt
good
list
but
you
could
have
made
it
top
16
led
zeppelin
songs
and
had
rock
and
roll
as
no
1
then
it
would
be
perfect…
dave
good
songs

wheres

http//birdsurfboardscom

why
in

jmurf
i
know
you
had
to
leave
out
a
few
but
for
me
their
best
song
is
bron
yyr
stomp
[not
sure
on
spelling]
its
a
foot
stomper
wearshades
i
do
love
“bronyaur
stomp”
jmurf
there
are
many
songs
on
led
zeppelin
iii
that
are
vastly
underrated
http//wwwcafepresscom/ravynscharm
ravyn
i
will
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
this
list
led
zepplin
rawx
(sorry)
not
going
to
go
and
listen
to
my
albums
now…
i
have
the
xm
playing
christmas
music
throughout
the
entire
house
(for
the
kids
they
love
it)
and
at
night
i
will
switch
it
to
the
adult
xmas
station
(some
of
those
song
are
really
not
for
little
ears)
http//myspacecom/_kollision
kelsi
awesome
list!!
i
love
zep!
eee!
although
honestly
i
don’t
really
like
no
quarter
all
that
much
compared
to
their
other
songs
=/
i
would
have
included
misty
mountain
hop
instead!
i
love
that
one
=)
anyway
any
led
zeppelin
&gt
most
other
music
arkz_archduke_of_geeks
leave
out
stairway
and
put
in
immigrant
or
as
kelsi
said
misty
mountain
hop
or
or
ramble
on…
my
personal
zep
favorite

i
personally
place
stairway
into
a
category
of
music
that
also
includes
queen’s
bohemian
rhapsody
rob
zombie’s
dragula
metallica’s
enter
sandman
and
you
know
more
like
it
that
one
song
from
them
almost
everybody
knows
and
immediately
say
hey
i
like
this
band
but
don’t
listen
to
anything
more
then
that
one
james
immigrant
song?
ejf
the
lemon
song
lordcalvert
good
list
but
i
sure
missed
tangerine
mary
it
is
interesting
you
say
kashmir
would
be
a
super
villain’s
theme
song
kevin
nash
used
it
as
his
theme
song
when
he
was
a
villain
in
tna
wrestling
the
kinkmistress
i
agree
with
the
top
50
idea…
i
think
i’m
one
of
the
few
of
my
generation
to
appreciate
zeppelin
most
others
are
infatuated
with
a
stupid
whiteboy
rapper
who
shall
remain
nameless
i
have
my
dad
to
thank
for
introducing
me
to
zeppelin
through
the
houses
of
the
holy
and
i
thank
him
every
time
i
hear
a
led
zeppelin
song!
over
the
hills
and
far
away
is
my
personal
fav
http//libertineefx2blogscom/
libertine
kashmir
would
have
been
number
one
for
me
i
also
liked
boogie
with
stu
20fan20
wheres
hats
off
to
roy
harper!!!!!
hehehe
i
could
not
resit
stairway
has
to
be
in
i
agree
gallows
pole
should
be
in
bronyaur
stomp
from
how
the
west
was
won
should
also
make
it
oh
heck
just
list
them
all
it
is
zepplin
after
all
gr8flddfn
i
however
do
not
agree
with
this
list
lol
gigaknight
this
list
is
good
but
where
is
the
rain
song???
even
plant
considers
it
his
best
vocal
performance
vastly
underrated
i
think
dave
i
know
one
thing
this
led
zep
list
had
made
me
dive
into
my
old
vinal
collection
methinks
i
need
to
rebuy
these
on
cd
and
howabout…
a
pink
floyd
list
)
teresa
three
words
traveling
riverside
blues
other
then
that
(and
leaving
out
going
to
california…)
awesome
list
very
hard
to
narrow
down
im
sure…
jbjr
fool
in
the
rain
and
rock
and
roll
should
be
in
too
punjar
i
definately
agree
with
levee
at
#1
but
d’yer
mak’er
and
what
is
and
what
should
never
be
should
be
on
here
bobby
led
zeppelin
the
single
greatest
rock
band
in
history
has
produced
so
many
masterpieces
that
it's
silly
(yet
still
fun)
to
narrow
down
to
just
15
it's
an
interesting
list
a
very
persuasive
case
can
be
made
for
zeppelin
being
the
most
popular
rock
band
of
all
time
(not
just
hard
rock)
the
most
recent
compelling
evidence
would
be
the
more
than
one
billion
hits
that
the
website
for
reunion
tickets
received
in
less
than
one
week
with
80000
inquiries
per
minute
coming
in
for
9
straight
days
also
considering
the
fact
that
zeppelin
have
outsold
every
band
in
history
worldwide
including
the
beatles
to
give
perspective
to
zep's
impact
relative
to
other
major
artists
they
have
outsold
the
who

and
the
list
goes
on
the
only
band
in
the
us
to
outsell
zeppelin
are
the
beatles
but
remember
that
their
total
includes
dozens
of
multimillion
selling
singles
as
most
people
know
zeppelin
was
not
a
singles
band
all
their
astonishing
numbers
were
generated
soley
on
the
strength
of
their
monumental
landmark
albums
with
virtuall
no
help
from
the
mainstream
music
press
the
people
knew
they
still
do
frank
your
exactly
right
led
zeppelin’s
music
sold
itself
led
zeppelin
never
hired
“pr”
personnel
like
the
beatles
did
(always
looking
to
be
on
television
and
being
interviewed)
there
is
no
doubt
that
led
zeppelin
(was/is)
the
best
group
to
ever
surface
in
this
universe
easily
man
for
man
the
greatest
musical
creation
ever
formed…
jimyan
i
love
page’s
work
on
presence
what
about
“for
your
life”
and
“tea
for
one”
top
fifteen
are
fun
but
too
subjective
hope
they
tour
next
year
wearshades
i
like
your
enthusiasm
bobby
but
zep
have
not
outsold
everyone
in
the
world
the
beatles
have
more
sales
worldwide
as
do
elvis
in
the
us
garth
brooks
has
also
outsold
them
bobby
actually
i
stated
that
the
only
‘band’
not
artist
to
outsell
zep
in
the
us
are
the
beatles
and
that
is
primarily
due
to
the
beatles
singles
success
but
speaking
of
elvis
the
same
holds
true
he
had
dozens
of
million
selling
singles
added
to
his
total
album
sales
not
to
take
away
anything
from
elvis
or
the
beatles
because
i
happen
to
be
a
major
fan
of
both
as
for
garth
his
album
sales
have
been
phenomenal
but
remember
that
roughly
the
last
40
million
albums
he
has
sold
have
been
moved
at
walmart
for
$499
each
in
worldwide
sales
i
have
several
sources
that
claim
led
zep
album
sales
are
unsurpassed
i
have
read
others
that
state
the
beatles
have
sold
more
‘records’
than
anyone
worldwide
but
they
are
including
many
millions
of
singles
worldwide
sales
have
always
been
somewhat
of
a
grey
area
because
of
the
antiquated
accounting
practices
of
many
countries
primarily
in
the
past
around
the
world
i
guess
we
are
splitting
hairs
here
but
my
primary
point
is
that
led
zeppelin’s
accomplishments
are
really
unique
when
you
consider
the
fact
that
their
rise
was
fueled
almost
exclusively
by
word
of
mouth
based
on
the
sheer
quality
of
their
recorded
music
and
their
volcanic
live
shows
with
practically
zero
coverage
or
help
from
the
mainstream
press
let
alone
a
cheering
section
ie
the
beatles
and
stones
in
this
regard
there
is
a
carry
over
to
this
day
i
mean
what
if
the
stones
or
bob
dylan
or
the
beatles
or
the
who
or
several
other
more
media
friendly
bands
had
received
a
billion
hits
on
a
site
for
reunion
tickets
with
80000
hits
a
minute
for
days
i
maintain
that
there
would
be
an
orgy
of
unbridled
worship
coverage
(particularly
from
rs
magazine)
but
what
kind
of
coverage
have
we
actually
seen
in
the
mainstream
music
media
for
the
unprecedented
demonstration
of
drawing
power
of
led
zeppelin
considering
the
magnitude
of
the
numbers
i
maintain
not
much
mark
um
where’s
rock
and
roll
and
whether
you
like
it
or
not
stairway
was
their
best
song
so
live
with
it
also
whole
lotta
love
should
definately
be
higher
than
no
8
i
think
stairway
should
be
1
whole
lotta
love
2
and
then
rock
and
roll
3
apart
from
that
though
it’s
a
great
list
bucslim
always
liked
over
the
hills
and
far
away
trampled
under
foot
and
the
immigrant
song
should
be
here
too
but
i
can’t
really
argue
with
what’s
been
chosen
mark
i
just
read
my
last
comment
holy
crap
it
was
pitiful
stairway
was
definitely
their
best
song
rock
and
roll
should
be
on
this
list
and
10
years
gone
wtf???
why
10
years
gone
the
rain
song
is
much
better
and
going
to
california
is
a
better
acoustic
piece
than
that’s
the
way
and
lastly
whole
lotta
love
should
definitely
be
at
least
number
3
if
not
2
this
is
a
pretty
biased
list
and
i’m
sorry
if
i
offend
anyone’s
views
in
this
comment
it’s
just
that
this
list
is
pretty
poor
sherry
the
rain
song
is
definitely
their
best
song
in
my
opinion
and
i
was
surprised
it
wasn’t
even
on
the
list…
gigaknight
is
right
it
is
very
underrated
d’yer
ma’ker
and
all
my
love
should
also
be
on
there…
gary
it’s
hard
for
me
to
sit
through
“achilles
last
stand”
—
yeah
the
drumming
bass
guitar
is
good
blah
blah
blah…
but
it’s
unmelodic
and
boring!
and
too
long
but
i
don’t
really
dig
“presence”
that
much
how
about
“hey
hey
what
can
i
do?”
“travellin’
riverside
blues”
and
there’s
not
a
weak
song
on
lz1
lz2
lz4
arkz_archduke_of_geeks
you
know
if
you
think
about
it
the
guys
from
led
zeppelin
were
geeks
alot
of
there
songs
were
about
fantasy
norse
and
lord
of
the
rings
in
particular
speaking
of
lord
of
the
rings
im
listening
to
misty
mountain
hop
as
i
type
this
caboose
i
agree
butterfishtrampled
underfoot
has
to
be
my
favorite
spocker
nitpick
you
show
“stairway
to
heaven”
as
a
single
if
memory
serves
me
it
was
never
released
as
a
single
also
you
forgot
“ramble
on”
“houses
of
the
holy”
and
“your
time
is
gonna
come”
muzz
d’yer
make’r
should
definitely
be
on
there
but
fool
in
the
rain
should
be
number
1
and
it’s
not
even
on
the
list
come
on!
ty
b
good
list
stairway
to
heaven
should
be
#1
and
when
the
levees
brake
number
3!
fools!
the
doors
rule!
hercules
decent
list
but
not
one
of
us
here
could
actually
‘rank’
them
as
we
all
tend
to
our
own
opinions
that
being
said
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
number
one
ever
zeppelin
song
on
technicality
epicness
and
artistic
presence
would
be
achilles
last
stand
the
definitive
zeppelin
song
the
emotion
robert
put
into
this
during
his
struggles
at
home
and
with
the
loss
of
his
son
bonham
and
jimmy
with
their
drug
battles
and
jones
with
his
need
to
continuously
delve
deeper
into
his
art
truly
elevated
the
band
into
a
host
of
new
genres
and
is
why
they
are
adored
by
so
many
different
styles
of
music
fanbois
to
this
day
trampled
underfoot?
baby
come
on
home?
the
song
remains
the
same
find
me
a
more
badass
riff
than
at
100
into
that
song
i
dont
wanna
say
it
but
you
gotta
take
this
list
offa
here
man
arubaboy
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
you
can
take
any
15
led
zep
songs
at
random
and
you
will
have
a
good
list
as
to
how
many
albums
they
sold
compared
to
other
acts
i
care
not
they
are
the
best
ever
people
listen
to
such
crap
these
days
fred
although
almost
impossible
to
create
a
list
with
only
15
good
job
i
would
however
take
achilles
last
stand
and
that’s
the
way
out
and
put
in
trampled
under
foot
along
with
bronyraur
stomp
fav
song
though
is
definately
no
quater
chris
good
list
glad
to
see
stairway
not
at
the
top
where’s
tangerine
gallows
pole
or
thank
you
get
the
led
out!
kfinn
i
thought
for
sure
stairway
would
be
number
1…
gcta3
where
is
the
rain
song??
codman
no
quarter
definitely
shouldnt
be
on
this
list
it
is
the
only
led
zeppelin
song
that
i
dont
like
stairway
to
heaven
should
definitely
be
number
1
xochilt
its
interesting
to
notice
usually
the
people
that
dont
understand
the
melodic
complexity
thought
and
emotions
put
into
the
music
miss
the
greatest
parts
or
just
undermind
it…
not
saying
that
is
the
case
with
your
opinion
that
would
be
ignorant…
but
i
don't
like
how
people
are
saying
so
and
so
shouldnt
be
on
the
list
when
nothing
can
be
wrong
if
there
is
no
right
its
just
the
guys
opinion
and
i
think
he
did
a
great
job
of
it
i
don't
think
stairway
should
have
been
first…
even
the
*****ing
solo
of
no
quarter
beats
stairway!
hahah
well
almost
and
when
you
say
its
the
only
song
you
dont
like
i
find
that
weird
but
thats
my
opinion
bro
marcy
ramble
on!
j
where
the
hell
is
rock
n
roll
or
the
ocean
or
the
song
remains
the
same??????????
theodore
there
needs
to
be
a
list
for
the
7
worst
led
zeppelin
songs
namely
the
7
songs
on
in
through
the
out
door
j
that
dude
is
right
in
through
the
out
door
(along
with
the
original
‘let
it
be’
album)is
the
album
tht
should
not
have
been
callan
what
is
and
what
should
never
be!
lwheeler4
i
am
very
happy
with
this
list!
led
zeppelin
is
one
of
my
favorite
bands
and
you
defiantly
got
most
of
my
favorites
on
this
list
i
would
of
liked
to
see
heartbreaker
but
still
overall
this
list
is
spoton
random
comment
does
anyone
else
find
a
resemblance
in
the
guitar
riff
at
225
on
babe
i’m
gonna
leave
you
and
the
main
guitar
riff
in
25
or
6
to
4
by
chicago?
