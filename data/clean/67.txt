the
history
of
walt
disney's
association
with
lewis
carroll's
alice
books
(alice
in
wonderland
through
the
lookingglass)
stretches
all
the
way
back
to
1923
when
disney
was
still
a
21yearold
filmmaker
trying
to
make
a
name
for
himself
in
kansas
city
when
his
first
series
of
short
cartoons
the
newman
laughograms
failed
to
recoup
production
costs
the
struggling
young
producer
tried
to
create
other
short
films
hoping
that
one
of
them
would
point
the
way
forward
the
last
of
these
kansas
city
works
was
called
alice's
wonderland
featuring
a
live
action
girl
(virginia
davis)
interacting
with
cartoon
characters
while
charming
the
short
failed
to
receive
much
notice
and
so
walt
disney
decided
to
abandon
producing
animated
films
and
left
kansas
city
to
become
a
liveaction
film
director
in
hollywood
after
months
of
trying
and
failing
to
find
work
in
liveaction
disney
partnered
with
his
older
brother
roy
to
create
the
disney
brothers
studio
and
they
revived
the
idea
of
producing
animated
shorts
the
independent
distributor
m
j
winkler
screened
walt's
1923
alice
short
and
found
it
promising
so
winkler
agreed
to
distribute
a
series
of
alice
comedies
for
the
disney
brothers
jubilant
walt
contacted
his
former
kansas
city
colleagues
and
brought
them
to
hollywood
to
work
on
the
new
series
(a
group
that
today
reads
like
a
who's
who
of
american
animation
legends
including
ub
iwerks
rudolph
ising
isadore
friz
freleng
and
hugh
harman)
from
1924
to
1926
the
disney
brothers
studio
produced
over
fifty
short
alice
comedies
the
success
of
this
silent
film
series
established
disney
as
a
film
producer
and
was
probably
significant
for
the
success
of
the
later
mickey
mouse
usually
credited
as
the
first
great
disney
success
walt
disney
had
a
longstanding
affection
for
alice
in
wonderland
for
instance
as
soon
as
he
began
discussing
making
featurelength
films
he
returned
repeatedly
to
the
idea
of
making
a
featurelength
version
of
alice
but
for
various
reasons
these
attempts
were
never
realized
prior
to
snow
white
and
the
seven
dwarfs
(1937)
disney
planned
on
making
alice
in
wonderland
his
first
featurelength
film
instead
like
the
early
alice
comedies
he
planned
on
using
a
combination
of
liveaction
and
animation
for
the
wonderland
sequences
and
in
early
1933
a
technicolor
screen
test
was
shot
with
mary
pickford
as
alice
this
first
attempt
by
disney
at
producing
an
alice
feature
was
eventually
tabled
when
paramount
released
their
own
1933
liveaction
version
with
a
script
by
cleopatra
director
joseph
mankiewicz
(brother
of
citizen
kane
(1941)
scribe
herman
j
mankiewicz)
and
a
cast
that
included
gary
cooper
as
the
white
knight
cary
grant
as
the
mock
turtle
and
wc
fields
as
humpty
dumpty
disney
did
not
abandon
the
idea
of
making
an
alice
feature
after
the
enormous
success
of
snow
white
and
the
seven
dwarfs
–
as
leonard
maltin
writes
in
his
history
of
walt
disney's
film
career
the
disney
films
walt
disney
officially
recorded
the
title
alice
in
wonderland
with
the
mpaa
in
1938
as
preparatory
work
began
on
this
possible
alice
feature
the
economic
devastation
of
the
second
world
war
as
well
as
the
demands
of
the
productions
of
pinocchio
(1940)
fantasia
(1940)
and
bambi
(1942)
pushed
the
alice
project
aside
after
the
war
in
1945
disney
proposed
a
liveaction/animated
version
of
alice
in
wonderland
that
would
star
ginger
rogers
and
would
utilize
the
techniques
seen
in
disney's
the
three
caballeros
(1945)
lisa
davis
waltz
who
would
eventually
voice
anita
radcliffe
in
disney's
one
hundred
and
one
dalmatians
was
also
considered
for
the
role
of
alice
in
this
proposed
version[2]
this
too
fell
through
and
in
1946
work
began
on
an
allanimated
version
of
alice
in
wonderland
that
would
feature
art
direction
heavily
based
on
the
famous
illustrations
of
sir
john
tenniel
this
version
was
storyboarded
but
was
ultimately
rejected
by
walt
as
was
yet
another
proposed
liveaction/animated
version
of
alice
that
would
star
luanna
patten
(seen
in
disney's
song
of
the
south
(1946)
and
so
dear
to
my
heart
(1948))
in
the
late
1940s
work
resumed
on
an
allanimated
alice
with
a
focus
on
comedy
music
and
spectacle
as
opposed
to
rigid
fidelity
to
the
books
and
finally
in
1951
walt
disney
released
a
featurelength
version
of
alice
in
wonderland
to
theaters
eighteen
years
after
first
discussing
ideas
for
the
project
and
almost
thirty
years
after
making
his
first
alice
comedy
disney's
final
version
of
alice
in
wonderland
followed
in
the
traditions
of
his
feature
films
like
fantasia
and
the
three
caballeros
in
that
walt
disney
intended
for
the
visuals
and
the
music
to
be
the
chief
source
of
entertainment
as
opposed
to
a
tightlyconstructed
narrative
like
snow
white
or
cinderella
(1950)
instead
of
trying
to
produce
an
animated
staged
reading
of
carroll's
books
disney
chose
to
focus
on
their
whimsy
and
fantasy
using
carroll's
prose
as
a
beginning
not
as
an
end
unto
itself
another
choice
was
decided
upon
for
the
look
of
the
film
rather
than
faithfully
reproducing
the
famous
illustrations
of
sir
john
tenniel
a
more
streamlined
and
less
complicated
approach
was
used
for
the
design
of
the
main
characters
background
artist
mary
blair
took
a
modernist
approach
to
her
design
of
wonderland
creating
a
world
that
was
recognizable
and
yet
was
decidedly
unreal
indeed
blair's
bold
use
of
color
is
one
of
the
film's
most
notable
features
finally
in
an
effort
to
retain
some
of
carroll's
imaginative
verses
and
poems
disney
commissioned
top
songwriters
to
compose
songs
built
around
them
for
use
in
the
film
a
record
number
of
potential
songs
were
written
for
the
film
based
on
carroll's
verses—over
30—and
many
of
them
found
a
way
into
the
film
if
only
for
a
few
brief
moments
alice
in
wonderland
would
boast
the
greatest
number
of
songs
included
in
any
disney
film
but
because
some
of
them
last
for
mere
seconds
(like
how
do
you
do
and
shake
hands
we'll
smoke
the
monster
out
'twas
brillig
the
caucus
race
and
others)
this
fact
is
frequently
overlooked
the
original
song
that
alice
was
to
sing
in
the
beginning
was
titled
beyond
the
laughing
sky
the
song
like
so
many
other
dropped
songs
was
not
used
by
the
producers
however
the
composition
was
kept
and
the
lyrics
were
changed
it
later
became
the
title
song
for
peter
pan
(which
was
in
production
at
the
same
time)
the
second
star
to
the
right
the
title
song
composed
by
sammy
fain
was
later
adopted
by
jazz
pianist
bill
evans
and
featured
on
his
sunday
at
the
village
vanguard
release
and
reception
the
neutrality
of
this
section
is
disputed
please
do
not
remove
this
message
until
the
dispute
is
resolved
(july
2009)
all
of
these
creative
decisions
were
met
with
great
criticism
from
fans
of
lewis
carroll
as
well
as
from
british
film
and
literary
critics
who
accused
disney
of
americanizing
a
great
work
of
english
literature[3]
disney
was
not
surprised
by
the
critical
reception
to
alice
in
wonderland
–
his
version
of
alice
was
intended
for
large
family
audiences
not
literary
critics
–
but
despite
all
the
long
years
of
thought
and
effort
the
film
met
with
a
lukewarm
response
at
the
box
office
and
was
a
sharp
disappointment
in
its
initial
release[4]
earning
an
estimated
$24
million
at
the
us
box
office
in
1951[5]
though
not
an
outright
disaster
the
film
was
never
rereleased
theatrically
in
walt
disney's
lifetime
airing
instead
every
so
often
on
network
television
in
fact
alice
in
wonderland
aired
as
the
second
episode
of
walt
disney's
disneyland
tv
series
on
abc
in
1954
in
a
severely
edited
version
cut
down
to
less
than
an
hour
in
the
disney
films
leonard
maltin
relates
animator
ward
kimball
felt
the
film
failed
because
it
suffered
from
too
many
cooks
–
directors
here
was
a
case
of
five
directors
each
trying
to
top
the
other
guy
and
make
his
sequence
the
biggest
and
craziest
in
the
show
this
had
a
selfcanceling
effect
on
the
final
product[6]
walt
disney
himself
felt
that
the
film
failed
because
alice
the
character
had
no
heart[7]
almost
two
decades
after
its
original
release
after
the
north
american
success
of
george
dunning's
animated
film
yellow
submarine
(1968)
disney's
version
of
alice
in
wonderland
suddenly
found
itself
in
vogue
with
the
times
in
fact
because
of
mary
blair's
art
direction
and
the
longstanding
association
of
carroll's
alice
in
wonderland
with
the
drug
culture
the
feature
was
rediscovered
as
something
of
a
head
film
(along
with
fantasia
and
the
three
caballeros)
among
the
