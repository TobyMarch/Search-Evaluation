and
how
well
respected

he
arrives
at

reasons
he
decides
against
it

gets
in
a
cab
and

question
annoys
the

woman
in

taking
turns
spitting
mouthfuls
of
their
drinks
into
each
other’s
faces
and
laughing
hysterically
he
interprets
the
couple’s
behavior
as
a
form
of
sexual
play
and
is
both
upset
and
aroused
by
it
after
smoking
a
couple
of
cigarettes

calls
faith
cavendish
a
woman
he
has
never
met

whose
number
he
got
from
an
acquaintance
at

thinks
he
remembers
hearing
that
she
used
to
be
a
stripper
and
he
believes
he
can
persuade
her
to
have
sex
with
him
he
calls
her
and
though
she
is
at
first
annoyed
to
be
called
at
such
a
late
hour
by
a
complete
stranger
she
eventually
suggests
that
they
meet
the
next
day

doesn’t
want
to
wait
that
long
and
winds
up
hanging
up
without
arranging
a
meeting

goes
downstairs
to
the
lavender
room

sits
at
a
table

the
waiter
realizes
he’s
a
minor

refuses
to
serve
him
he
flirts
with
three
women
in

seem
like
they’re
from
out
of
town
and
are
mostly
interested
in
catching
a
glimpse
of
a
celebrity
nevertheless
holden
dances
with
them
and
feels
that
he
is
“half
in
love”
with
the
blonde
one
after
seeing
how
well
she
dances
after
making
some
wisecracks
about
his

entire
tab
as

goes
out

to
cry

beside
her
and

her
all
over

'the
song
“comin’
thro’
the
rye”
asks
if
it
is
wrong
for
two
people
to
have
a
romantic
encounter
out
in
the
fields
away
from
the
public
eye
even
if
they
don’t
plan
to
have
a
commitment
to
one
another'
i
thought
the
'rye'
referred
to
in
robert
burns'
poem
was
the
river
rye
hence
the
lines
'jenny's
a
wet
poor
body
jenny's
seldom
dry'
in
this
regard
it
is
about
two
people
who
meet
at
a
river
with
no
crossing
which
will
cause
people
to
question
why
one
of
them
is
wet

what
they

from
this

for

and
is
a
very
important
quotation!

the
thing
with

is
if
they

for
the

you
have
to

them
do
it
and
not

anything
if
they

it's
