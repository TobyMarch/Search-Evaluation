they
became
one
of

group
ever
to
take
part
in
the
contest
abba
has
sold
over
370
million
records
worldwide
and
still
sells
millions
of
records
a
year[1][2]
which
makes
them
one
of
the
bestselling
music
artists
of
all
time
abba
was
the
first
pop
group
to
come
from
a
nonenglishspeaking
country
that
enjoyed
consistent
success
in
the
charts
of
englishspeaking
countries
including
the

ireland
the

canada
australia
new

in
latin
american
markets
and
recorded
a
collection
of
their
hit
songs
in

during
the
band's
active
years
f&aumlltskog
and
ulvaeus
were
a
married
couple
as
were
lyngstad
and
andersson
although
both
couples
later
divorced
at
the
height
of
their
popularity
both
relationships
were
suffering
strain
which
ultimately
resulted
in
the
collapse
of
the
ulvaeusf&aumlltskog
marriage
in
1979
and
the
anderssonlyngstad
marriage
in
1981
these
relationship
changes
were
reflected
in
the
group's
music[citation
needed]
with
later
compositions
including
more
introspective
lyrics
after
abba
broke
up
in
late
1982
andersson
and
ulvaeus
achieved
success
writing
music
for
the
stage
while
lyngstad
and
f&aumlltskog
pursued
solo
careers
with
mixed
success
abba's
music
declined
in
popularity
until
several
films
notably
muriel's
wedding
and
the
adventures
of
priscilla
queen
of
the
desert
revived
interest
in
the
group
spawning
several
tribute
bands
in
1999
abba's
music
was
adapted
into
the
successful
musical
mamma
mia!
that
toured
worldwide
a
film
of
the
same
name
released
in
2008
became
the
highestgrossing
film
in
the

s&aring
k&aumlr
lundkvist
was
so
impressed
with
her
voice
that
he
was
convinced
she
would
be
a
star
after
going
through
considerable
effort
to
locate
the
singer
he
arranged
for
agnetha
to
come
to

self
composed
song

selling
more
than
80000

at
number
17
in
the
swedish
combined
single
and
album
charts
enough
to
convince
them
they
were
on
to
something[15]
the
single
also
became
the
first
record
to
chart
for
the
quartet
in
the
united
states
where
it
peaked
at

labeled

(with

flicka)
it
was
released
there
through
playboy
records
however
according
to
stig
anderson
people
need
love
could
have
been
a
much
bigger
american
hit
but
a
small
label
like
playboy
records
did
not
have
the
distribution
resources
to
meet
the
demand
for
the
single
from
retailers
and
radio
programmers[16]
the
foursome
decided
to
record
their
first
album
together
in
the
autumn
of
1972
and
sessions
began
on
26
september
1972
the
women
shared
lead
vocals
on
nina
pretty
ballerina
(a
top
ten
hit
in
austria)
that
day
and
their
voices
in
harmony
for
the
first
time
gave
the
foursome
an
idea
of
the
quality
of
their
combined
talents
ring

in
1973
the
band
and
their
manager
stig
anderson
decided
to
have
another
try
at
melodifestivalen
this
time
with
the
song
ring
ring
the
studio
sessions
were
handled
by
michael
b
tretow
who
experimented
with
a
wall
of
sound
production
technique
that
became
the
wholly
new
abba
sound
stig
anderson
arranged
an
english
translation
of
the
lyrics
by
neil
sedaka
and
phil
cody
and
they
thought
this
would
be
a
surefire
winner
however
on
10
february
1973
the
song
came
third
in
melodifestivalen
thus
it
never
reached
the
eurovision
song
contest
itself
nevertheless
the
group
released
their
debut
studio
album
also
called
ring
ring
the
album
did
well
and
the
ring
ring
single
was
a
hit
in
many
parts
of
europe
and
also
in
south
africa
however
stig
anderson
felt
that
the
true
breakthrough
could
only
come
with
a
uk
or
us
hit[17]
official
naming
in
early
1973
stig
anderson
tired
of
unwieldy
names
started
to
refer
to
the
group
privately
and
publicly
as
abba
at
first
this
was
a
play
on
words
as
abba
is
also
the
name
of
a
wellknown
fishcanning
company
in
sweden
and
itself
an
acronym
however
since
the
fishcanners
were
unknown
outside
sweden
anderson
came
to
believe
the
name
would
work
in
international
markets
a
competition
to
find
a
suitable
name
for
the
group
was
held
in
a
gothenburg
newspaper
the
group
was
impressed
with
the
names
alibaba
fabb
and
baba
but
in
the
end
all
the
entries
were
ignored
and
it
was
officially
announced
in
the
summer
that
the
group
were
to
be
known
as
abba
the
group
negotiated
with
the
canners
for
the
rights
to
the
name[18]
abba
is
an
acronym
formed
from
the
first
letters
of
each
group
member's
first
name
agnetha
bj&oumlrn
benny
and
annifrid[19]
during
a
promotional
photo
benny
flipped
his
b
horizontally
for
fun
and
from
1976
onwards
the
first
'b'
in
the
logo
version
of
the
name
was
mirrorimage
reversed
on
the
band's
promotional
material
and
ᗅᗺᗷᗅ
became
the
group's
registered
trademark
the
first
time
abba
is
found
written
on
paper
is
on
a
recording
session
sheet
from
the
metronome
studio
in
stockholm
dated
16
october
1973
this
was
first
written
as
bj&oumlrn
benny
agnetha

frida
but
was
subsequently
crossed
out
with
abba
written
in
large
letters
on
top
the
official
logo
using
the
bold
version
of
the
news
gothic
typeface
was
designed
by
rune
s&oumlderqvist
and
appeared
for
the
first
time
on
the
dancing
queen
single
in
august
1976
and
subsequently
on
all
later
original
albums
and
singles
but
the
idea
for
the
official
logo
was
made
by
the
german
photographer
wolfgang
heilemann
on
a
dancing
queen
shoot
for
the
teenage
magazine
bravo
on
the
photo
the
abba
members
held
a
giant
initial
letter
of
his/her
name
after
the
pictures
were
made
heilemann
found
out
that
one
of
the
men
held
his
letter
backwards
as
in
ᗅᗺᗷᗅ&reg
they
discussed
it
and
the
members
of
abba
liked
it
following
their
acquisition
of
the
group's
catalogue
polygram
began
using
variations
of
the
abba
logo
using
a
different
font
and
adding
a
crown
emblem
to
it
in
1992
for
the
first
release
of
the
abba
gold
greatest
hits
compilation
when
universal
music
purchased
polygram
(and
thus
abba's
label
polar
music
international)
control
of
the
group's
catalogue
was
returned
to
stockholm
since
then
the
original
logo
has
been
reinstated
on
all
official
products[20]

(1973–1976)
abba

an
appearance
on
dutch
tv
in
april
1974
eurovision
as
the
group
entered
the
melodifestivalen
with
ring
ring
but
failed
to
qualify
as
the
1973
swedish
entry
stig
anderson
immediately
started
planning
for
the
1974
contest
ulvaeus
andersson
and
stig
anderson
believed
in
the
possibilities
of
using
melodifestivalen
and
the
eurovision
song
contest
as
a
way
to
make
the
music
business
aware
of
them
as
songwriters
as
well
as
the
band
itself
in
late
1973
they
were
invited
by
swedish
television
to
contribute
a
song
for
the
melodifestivalen
1974
and
from
a
number
of
new
songs
the
upbeat
number
waterloo
was
chosen
the
group
was
now
inspired
by
the
growing
glam
rock
scene
in
england
waterloo
was
an
unashamedly
glamstyle
pop
track
produced
with
michael
b
tretow's
wallofsound
approach
and
it
bears
a
notable
resemblance
in
both
arrangement
and
production
to
wizzard's
1973
uk
hit
see
my
baby
jive[original
research?]
abba
won
their
national
heats
on
swedish
television
on
9
february
1974
and
with
this
third
attempt
were
far
more
experienced
and
better
prepared
for
the
eurovision
song
contest
winning
the
1974
contest
on
6
april
1974
gave
abba
the
chance
to
tour
europe
and
perform
on
major
television
shows
thus
the
band
saw
the
waterloo
single
chart
in
many
european
countries
waterloo
was
abba's
first
number
one
single
in
big
markets
such
as
the
uk
and
germany
in
the
united
states
the
song
peaked
at
number
six
on
the
billboard
hot
100
chart
paving
the
way
for
their
first
album
and
their
first
trip
as
a
group
there
albeit
a
short
promotional
visit
it
included
their
first
performance
on
american
television
the
mike
douglas
show
the
album
waterloo
only
peaked
at
number
145
on
the
billboard
200
chart
but
received
unanimous
high
praise
from
the
us
critics
los
angeles
times
called
it
a
compelling
and
fascinating
debut
album
that
captures
the
spirit
of
mainstream
pop
quite
effectively



an
immensely
enjoyable
and
pleasant
project
while
creem
characterized
it
as
a
perfect
blend
of
exceptional
lovable
compositions[citation

abba's
followup
single
honey
honey
peaked
at
number
27
on
the
us

and
was
a
number

in

in

abba's

decided
to
rerelease
a

of

within

of

to
reach

that
the

in
november
1974
abba
embarked
on
their
first
european
tour
playing
dates
in
denmark
west
germany
and
austria
it
was
not
as
successful
as
the
band
had
hoped
since
most
of
the
venues
did
not
sell
out
due
to
a
lack
of
demand
they
were
even
forced
to
cancel
a
few
shows
including
a
sole
concert
scheduled
in
switzerland
the
second
leg
of
the
tour
which
took
them
through
scandinavia
in
january
1975
was
very
different
they
played
to
full
houses
everywhere
and
finally
got
the
reception
they
had
aimed
for
live
performances
continued
during
the
summer
of
1975
when
abba
embarked
on
a
sixteen
openair
date
tour
of
sweden
and
finland
their
stockholm
show
at
the

amusement
park
had
an
estimated
audience
of
19200[21]
in
late
1974
so
long
was
released
as
a
single
in
the
united
kingdom
but
it
received
no
airplay
from
radio

and
failed
to
chart
in
the
summer
of
1975
abba
released

again
received
little
airplay
on

but
managed
to
climb
the

to
number
38
later
in
1975
the
release
of
their
selftitled
third
studio
album
abba
and
single
sos
brought
back
their
chart
presence
in
the
uk
where
the
single
hit
number
6
and
the
album
peaked
at
number
13
sos
also
became
abba's
second
number

in

success
was
further
solidified
with

reaching

in

on

on

picking
up
the
bmi
award
along
the
way
as
one
of
the
most
played
songs
on
american
radio
in
1975
the
success
of
the
group
in
the
united
states
had
until
that
time
been
limited
to
single
releases
by
early
1976
the
group
already
had
four
top
30
singles
on
the
us
charts
but
the
album
market
proved
to
be
tough
to
crack
the
eponymous
abba
album
generated
three
american
hits
but
it
only
peaked
at
number
165
on
the
cashbox
album
chart
and
number
174
on
the
billboard
200
chart
opinions
were
voiced
by
creem
in
particular
that
in
the
us
abba
had
endured
a
very
sloppy
promotional
campaign
nevertheless
the
group
enjoyed
warm
reviews
from
the
american
press
cashbox
went
as
far
as
saying
that
there
is
a
recurrent
thread
of
taste
and
artistry
inherent
in
abba's
marketing
creativity
and
presentation
that
makes
it
almost
embarrassing
to
critique
their
efforts
while
creem
wrote
sos
is
surrounded
on
this
lp
by
so
many
good
tunes
that
the
mind
boggles
in

the
airing

rapidly
gain
enormous
popularity
and

become
a

of
the

this
started
an

the

denied
the

of

(who
are
we
without

initials
of

and
lyngstad
and

there
was
nothing
that
could
entice
them
back
on
stage
again
ulvaeus
said
we
will
never
appear
on
stage
again
[]
there
is
simply
no
motivation
to
regroup
money
is
not
a
factor
and
we
would
like
people
to
remember
us
as
we
were
young
exuberant
full
of
energy
and
ambition
i
remember
robert
plant
saying
led

were

cover
all
their

obstacle

raised
the
possibility

fashion
videos
advertising
campaigns
abba
were
widely
noted
for
the
colourful
and
trendsetting
costumes
its
members
wore[citation
needed]
the
videos
that
accompanied
some
of
their
biggest
hits
are
often
cited[by
whom?]
as
being
among
the
earliest
examples
of
the
genre
most
of
abba's
videos
(and
abba
the
movie)
were
directed
by
lasse
hallstr&oumlm
who
would
later
direct
the
films
my
life
as
a
dog
the
cider
house
rules
and
chocolat
abba
made
videos
because
their
songs
were
hits
in
many
different
countries
and
personal
appearances
were
not
always
possible
this
was
also
done
in
an
effort
to
minimize
travelling
particularly
to
countries
that
would
have
required
extremely
long
flights
f&aumlltskog
and
ulvaeus
had
two
young
children
and
f&aumlltskog
who
was
also
afraid
of
flying
was
very
reluctant
to
leave
her
children
for
such
a
long
time
abba's
manager
stig
anderson
realized
the
potential
of
showing
a
simple
video
clip
on
television
to
publicize
a
single
or
album
thereby
allowing
easier
and
quicker
exposure
than
a
concert
tour
some
of
these
videos
became
classics
because
of
the
1970sera
costumes
and
early
video
effects
such
as
the
grouping
of
the
band
members
in
different
combinations
of
pairs
overlapping
one
singer's
profile
with
the
other's
full
face
and
the
contrasting
of
one
member
against
another
in
1976
abba
participated
in
a
highprofile
advertising
campaign
by
the
matsushita
electric
industrial
(today's
panasonic
corporation)
which
was
designed
to
promote
the
brand
national
this
campaign
was
designed
initially
for
australia
where
national
was
still
the
primary
brand
used
by
matsushita
who
had
not
introduced
the
panasonic
brand
to
australia
yet
despite
its
widespread
use
in
other
parts
of
the
world
such
as
the
united
states
however
the
campaign
was
also
aired
in
japan
five
commercials
each
approximately
one
minute
long
were
produced
each
using
the
national
song
sung
by
abba
which
used
the
melody
and
instrumental
arrangement
of
fernando
adapted
with
new
lyrics
promoting
national
and
working
in
several
slogans
used
by
national
in
their
advertising[54]
political
controversy
in
september
2010
band
members
andersson
and
ulvaeus
criticized
the
rightwing
danish
people's
party
(df)
for
using
the
abba
song
mamma
mia
(with
modified
lyrics)
at
rallies
the
band
had
threatened
to
file
a
lawsuit
against
the
df
saying
they
never
allowed
their
music
to
be
used
politically
and
that
they
had
absolutely
no
interest
in
supporting
the
party
their
record
label
universal
music
later
said
that
no
legal
action
would
be
taken
because
an
agreement
had
been
reached[55]
