plot
according
to
lapine
culture
and
mythology
the
world
was
created
by
the
god
frith
who
represents
the
sun
all
animals
lived
harmoniously
but
the
rabbits
eventually
multiplied
and
their
appetite
led
to
a
food
shortage
at
the
prayers
of
the
desperate
animals
frith
warned
the
rabbit
prince
elahrairah
to
control
his
people
but
was
scoffed
at
in
retaliation
frith
gave
special
gifts
to
every
animal
but
some
animals
he
made
predators
to
prey
upon
the
rabbits
satisfied
that
elahrairah
had
learned
his
lesson
frith
also
gave
the
rabbits
speed
and
cunning
while
many
would
seek
to
kill
them
the
rabbits
could
survive
by
their
wits
and
quickness
in
the
present
in
the
english
countryside
of

overly
resigned
attitudes
and
leaves

irked
bigwig

and

production
the
film
was
originally
to
be
directed
by
john
hubley
who
died
in
1977
his
work
can
still
be
found
in
the
film
most
notably
in
the
fable
scene
he
was
replaced
by
the
film's
producer
martin
rosen
his
directorial
debut
after
the
genesis
story
rendered
in
a
narrated
simple
cartoon
fashion
the
animation
style
changes
to
a
detailed
naturalist
one
with
concessions
to
render
the
animals
anthropomorphic
only
to
suggest
they
have
human
voices
and
minds
some
facial
expressions
for
emotion
and
paw
gestures
the
animation
backgrounds
are
watercolours
only
one
of
the
predators
the
farm
cat
tab
is
given
a
few
lines
the
rest
remaining
mute
the
backgrounds
and
locations
especially
efrafa
and
the
nearby
railway
are
based
to
the
diagrams
and
maps
in
richard
adams's
book
most
of
the
locations
in
this
movie
either
exist
or
were
based
on
real
spots
in
hampshire
and
surrounding
areas
although
the
film
was
fairly
faithful
to
the
novel
several
changes
were
made
to
the
storyline
mainly
to
decrease
overdetailed
complexity
and
improve
pace
and
flow
of
the
plot
in
addition
the
order
in
which
some
events
occur
is
rearranged
unlike
many
animated
features
the
film
faithfully
emulated
the
dark
and
violent
sophistication
of
the
book
as
a
result
many
reviewers
took
to
warning
parents
that
children
might
find
the
content
disturbing
the
bbfc
rated
the
film
'u'
(suitable
for
all)
deciding
that
whilst
the
film
may
move
children
emotionally
during
the
films
duration
it
could
not
seriously
trouble
them
once
the
spell
of
the
story
is
broken
and
a
'u'
certificate
was
therefore
quite
appropriate
[2]
however
in
2012
the
bbfc
admitted
that
it
has
received
complaints
about
the
suitability
of
watership
down
at
u
almost
every
year
since
its
classification[3]
this
attitude
extended
to
when
the
animated
watership
down
tv
series
was
marketed
with
the
producers
making
an
effort
to
reassure
parents
that
the
violence
was
softened
and
that
the
main
characters
would
not
be
permanently
harmed
in
their
adventures
some
marketers
in
the
us
were
also
worried
that
the
main
promotional
poster
(see
above)
appeared
too
dark
and
might
scare
some
children
the
poster
is
actually
showing
bigwig
in
a
snare
(his
distinctive
fur
is
clearly
visible)
and
the
image
on
the
poster
does
not
appear
in
the
film
which
has
a
far
bloodier
depiction
of
the
scene
music
the
musical
score
was
by
angela
morley
and
malcolm
williamson
morley
replacing
williamson
after
the
composer
had
fallen
behind
and
only
composed
the
prelude
and
main
title
theme
in
sketch
form[4]
a
list
of
the
musical
cues
for
the
film
can
be
found
on
the
composer's
website
which
also
gives
information
about
the
different
composers
working
on
the
project[5]
the
soundtrack
included
art
garfunkel's
british
no
1
hit
bright
eyes
which
was
written
by
the
british
singer
and
songwriter
mike
batt
(although
in
a
different
arrangement
from
the
one
released
as
a
single)
batt
also
wrote
other
songs
for
the
film
which
were
not
used
the
composer
recorded
three
songs
with
vocals
by
garfunkel
but
only
bright
eyes
made
it
to
the
film
the
song
when
you're
losing
your
way
in
the
rain
has
a
very
similar
feeling
and
arrangement
and
was
recorded
by
the
former
zombies
vocalist
colin
blunstone
in
1979
garfunkel's
version
was
heard
years
later
on
the
tv
series
soundtrack
released
in
2000
the
song
like
many
others
which
appeared
on
the
tv
soundtrack
was
never
used
in
the
show
another
song
watership
down
was
written
by
gerry
beckley
of
america
for
use
as
the
theme
song
it
was
never
used
but
the
band
recorded
it
for
their
1976
album
hideaway
an
alternative
mix
can
be
found
on
the
box
set
highway
reception
the
film
has
received
a
generally
positive
critical
reception
with
an
81%
'fresh'

on
rotten

and
a

from
