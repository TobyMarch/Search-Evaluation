guest
i
have
viewed
your
review
i
muat
say
i
don’t
agree
with
your
synopsis
of
the
video
i
agree
that
the
‘phantom
menace’
has
its
faults
and
flaws
but
its
obvious
that
you
grew
up
with
the
original
three
movies
and
have
a
closed
opinion
on
the
newer
ones
as
most
star
wars
fanboys
have
darkcyberelf
&nbspi
was
born
in
the
90′s
and
was
about
8
or
9
years
old
when
i
first
saw
this
film
and
i’m
going
to
be
honest
i
didn’t
know
what
the
hell
was
going
on
and
i
certainly
don’t
know
now
it
is
the
most
confusing
and
pointless
of
the
star
wars
films
is
it
entertaining?
yes
at
time
but
mostly
it’s
just
complete
shit
compared
to
the
simplicity
originality
and
development
the
original
trilogy
had
everything
this
guy
said
was
completely
valid
regardless
of
which
films
you
prefer
i
personally
like
this
film
but
for
illogical
reasons
this
movie
is
bad
this
is
the
worst
star
wars
movie
those
are
facts
he
has
just
proven
cablecar830
i
agree
with
your
point
that
he
seems
like
he
loved
the
originals
too
much
but
a
lot
of
it
was
pretty
pointless
but
overall
i
love
all
of
the
films
it’s
more
than
a
story
it’s
a
legend
and
everyone
that
picks
on
it
in
way
too
much
detail
isn’t
aware
that
george
lucas
made
it
the
way
he
wanted
to
and
now
he’d
got

scott
hanselman
okorugaijin
the
security
chief
says
their
security
volunteers
(which
makes
them
sound
like
mall
cops
or
concert
bouncers—these
are
the
people
in
charge
of
protecting
the
queen
and
the
rest
of
the
planet?)
would
be
no
match
against…”a
battlehardened
federation
army”?
what?
when
the
big
final
battle
takes
place
they’re
almost
entirely
fighting
regiments
of
droids
the
term
“battlehardened”
refers
to
someone
who
has
been
through
numerous
wars
and
conflicts
and
has
had
their
sensitivities
resilience
and
training
steeled
over
as
a
result
usually
this
person
is
pretty
valuable
in
a
fight
“battlehardened”
would
be
appropriate
if
you
were
referring
to
like
a
human
or
some
other
type
of
carbonbased
life
form
that
could
experience
things
like
fear
pain
or
emotion
but
these
are
fucking
robots
the
most
“lifelike”
thing
they
do
is
say
“roger
roger”
back
to
the
giant
computer
that
probably
controls
them
they’re
not
the
fucking
urukhai
besides
from
the
way
the
jedi
cut
these
things
in
half
by
the
dozen
i’d
say
they’re
pretty
expendable…not
valuable
they’re
like
cheap
plastic
toys
that
all
look
the
same
(cue
“we’re
in
the
money”
music)
as
soon
as
one
gets
demolished
it
just
gets
replaced
by
another
on
that
looks
exactly
the
same
and
has
the
same
orders
they
don’t
need
to
be
“battlehardened”
from
numerous
conflicts
michael
technically
the
urukhai
were
made
right
before
helms
deep…
meaning
they
weren’t
battlehardened
either…
at
least
that’s
my
recollection…
http//wwwfacebookcom/jacksoncampbell14224
jackson
campbell
the
urukhai
were
active
in
the
events
of
the
first
book
where
they
attack
the
fellowship
and
kill
boromir
they
also
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
fighting
small
bands
of
rohirim
and
raiding
settlements
so
they
were
not
wholly
untested
but
neither
had
they
faced
determined
resistance
(with
out
most
of
them
being
killed)
http//wwwfacebookcom/patrickallen735
patrick
allen
same
as
what
jackson
c
said
but
also
the
urukhai
were
at
least
competently
“programmed”
so
to
speak
i
don’t
even
know
how
the
trade
federation
is
profitable
considering
how
many
resources
they
must
go
through
to
churn
out
so
many

when
you
have

a
complicated
scrutiny
of
plot
details
like
sw
(as
opposed
to
star
trek
which
can
work
as
a
nerd
niche)
you
really
have
to
focus
on
universal
elements
of
storytelling
and
visuals
you
can’t
just
have
a
bunch
of
mindless
logistical
dialogue
that
creates
all
these
new
rules
that’s
why
this
is
‘fantasy

as

scifi
it’s
supposed
to
be
fucking
universal
and
accessible!!!

anakin
should
have
been
the
luke
of
the
prequels
starting
ep1
the
same
age
as
luke
in
epiv
lucas
could
have
just
aped
the
sequels
and
no
one
would
have
faulted
him
no
one
wanted
godfather
here
just
sw
making
the
character
of
anakin
switch
actors
33%
of
the
way
through
the
trilogy
is
absolutely
mind
boggling
obviously
the
reasoning
was”
now
it
gots
a
little
kid!”
the
closest
i
can
get
to
identifying
a
protagonist
in
this
mess
is
ep1
obiwan
quigon
and
anakin
are
all
the
protagonist
ep2
obiwan
and
anakin
are
both
the
protagonist
ep3
anakin
is
the
protagonist
3
anakin
and
obiwan’s
friendship
doesn’t
make
very
much
sense
due
to
their
age
difference
of…
i’ll
say
at
least
10
years
actually
the
way
these
movies
work
it’s
almost
as
if
anakin
catches
up
in
age
to
obiwan
this
movie
is
13
years
old
and
i
still
can’t
forget
how
much
of
a
clusterfuck
it
was
tom
am
i
the
only
one
slightly
put
off
by
the
fact
that
padme
seems
about
three
times
annakin’s
age
in
the
first
movie
yet
by
the
third
anakin
seems
slightly
older?
bananna
hammock
apparently
you
missed
the
big
*if*
right
before
that
statement
grandam
the
prequels
are
such
a
colossal
failure
because
they
lack
the
most
basic
elements
that
make
a
movie
worth
watching
it
lacks
characters
and
a
coherent
story
it’s
as
if
they
took
all
the
old
star
wars
staples
and
electrofied
them
they
didn’t
bother
with
a
story
or
characters
it’s
totally
obvious
i’m
not
a
writer
and
i
could
have
made
a
better
story
here’s
something
just
off
the
top
of
my
head
it
wouldn’t
be
that
hard
to
do
and
it
ties
up
the
story
nicely
to
coincide
with
the
start
of
a
new
hope
obiwan
is
a
younger
more
hotheaded
jedi
than
in
the
original
trilogy
he
finds
anakin
and
wants
to
train
him
because
he
senses
his
potential
with
the
force
when
he
asks
the
permission
of
the
jedi
council
they
deny
him
the
opportunity
so
he
trains
him
in
secret
yoda
finds
out
that
obiwan
is
secretly
training
anakin
and
has
anakin
brought
into
the
jedi
order
so
obiwan
doesn’t
get
into
trouble
anakin
advances
through
his
training
quickly
he
becomes
more
and
more
powerful
but
he’s
reckless
and
prone
to
giving
in
to
his
emotions
the
council
is
wary
of
this
and
slows
his
training
and
ascent
through
the
ranks
anakin
starts
to
become
impatient
with
the
council
always
doubting
him
he
believes
they’re
jealous
and
scared
of
his
true
potential
palpatine
talks
to
anakin
tells
him
that
there
is
another
group
that
uses
the
force
that
would
allow
him
to
advance
much
quicker
and
to
attain
even
greater
power
with
the
force
anakin
slowly
turns
to
the
dark
side
becoming
more
and
more
distant
to
the
jedi
order
obiwan
realizes
this
and
eventually
finds
out
that
anakin
is
consorting
with
a
sith
lord
he
eventually
confronts
anakin
and
duels
him
in
an
effort
to
stop
him
obiwan
wins
the
duel
but
can’t
bring
himself
to
kill
anakin
instead
he
leaves
him
severely
maimed
hoping
that
this
will
stop
his
quest
for
power
this
is
where
anakin
becomes
darth
vader
filled
with
hatred
for
the
jedi
particularly
his
old
friend
obiwan
he
works
with
palpatine
to
eliminate
the
jedi
council
(as
they’re
the
only
group
that
has
any
real
power
to
oppose
him)
all
the
jedi
are
hunted
down
and
eliminated
only
a
few
manage
to
escape
obiwan
takes
baby
luke
and
heads
off
to
tatooine
leaving
baby
leia
to
the
organas
on
alderaan
he
does
this
out
of
fear
that
darth
vader’s
children
would
be
equally
as
powerful
with
the
force
and
that
they’d
be
corrupted
to
the
dark
side
he
goes
into
hiding
on
tatooine
so
he
can
watch
luke
while
avoiding
being
killed
in
the
ensuing
hunt
for
the
remaining
jedi
he
also
hides
out
of
shame
for
having
brought
the
end
of
the
jedi
order
which
had
existed
for
thousands
of
generations
yoda
flees
to
dagobah
because
he
fears
the
jedi
order
is
destroyed
and
there
is
nothing
else
he
can
do
to
change
that
fill
that
basic
outline
with
scenes
depicting
obiwan
and
anakin
going
through
adventures
and
you’d
have
a
much
better
trilogy
guest
your
alternative
is
generic
and
highly
cliche
but
coherent
and
understandable
at
its
core
lucas’
script
for
episodes
i
ii
and
iii
is
very
much
the
same
it’s
generic
and
not
particularly
clever
but
it’s
coherent
think
about
it
if
i
simplified
the
story
to
its
most
basic
elements
we’d
get
something
that
sounds
as
palatable
as
your
own
proposal
obi
wan
is
a
young
somewhat
impulsive
jedi
being
mentored
by
li’emni
sohn
a
powerful
jedi
master
while
traveling
a
barren
desert
world
they
stumble
across
a
young
boy
named
anakin
whose
innate
potential
with
the
force
is
so
great
that
it
astonishes
both
of
them
obiwan
senses
that
he
is
destined
for
great
things
and
covets
the
chance
to
be
the
one
who
trains
him
allowing
his
desire
to
do
so
to
cloud
his
normally
sound
judgment
the
young
anakin
grows
in
power
but
as
he
enters
his
tumultuous
adolescence
he
chafes
under
what
he
feels
is
the
oppression
of
the
jedi
order
at
the
core
of
his
rebellion
is
a
disagreement
the
jedi
order
demands
that
its
adherents
master
and
suppress
their
emotion
because
failure
to
do
so
has
led
jedi
in
the
past
to
wield
their
power
to
do
horrible
things
in
pursuit
of
their
passions
anakin
does
not
understand
this
and
wouldn’t
agree
with
it
even
if
he
did
all
he
sees
is
that
the
order
is
trying
to
keep
him
from
the
woman
he
loves
passionately
he
carries
on
his
quiet
rebellion
out
of
the
sights
of
the
jedi
order
some
of
the
higherups
know
but
keep
their
eyes
halfshut
because
on
some
level
they
feel
the
code
is
too
strict
as
well
anakin
grows
in
power
and
begins
to
perceive
new
subtleties
in
the
force
one
day
tapping
deeply
into
it
he
has
a
vision
that
terrifies
him
of
his
beautiful
wife
dying
he
refuses
to
accept
that
this
is
true
he
fights
to
try
to
find
a
way
around
it
everything
he
knows
about
the
force
suggests
that
what
he’s
seen
is
unavoidable
finally
he’s
faced
with
a
choice
accept
that
his
wife
has
to
die
or
throw
away
every
shred
of
the
things
he’s
been
taught
in
a
desperate
bid
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
force
the
side
he’s
been
taught
is
evil
there
may
be
an
answer
for
him
meanwhile
on
the
other
side
a
very
powerful
and
intelligent
evil
sees
this
and
senses
an
opportunity
to
turn
one
of
the
most
powerful
jedi
ever
produced
into
his
loyal
servant
all
he
has
to
do
is
lie
and
tell
the
young
man
that
on
the
dark
side
there
really
is
a
way
to
save
his
wife
and
so
anikin
allows
himself
to
be
corrupted
and
by
the
time
he
realizes
what
is
happening
he’s
too
late
to
change
what
he’s
become
or
the
horrible
things
he
has
done
he
wakes
to
find
he’s
a
slave
to
a
new
master
fill
that
basic
outline
with
scenes
depicting
obiwan
and
anakin
going
through
adventures
and
you’d
have
a
pretty
decent
trilogy…
or
well
you
might
the
problem
is
not
the
basic
plot
idea
that
lucas
used
the
problem
is
how
he
fleshed
it
out
he
took
the
simple
central
narrative
of
the
first
three
episodes
which
could
have
been
brilliant
in
the
hands
of
somebody
who
cared
about
things
like
logic
and
coherency
and
buried
it
under
several
layers
of
shit
neglect
and
bad
acting
he
made
no
apparent
effort
to
screen
it
for
internal
contradictions
apparently
never
asked
himself
if
the
characters
were
believable
and
didn’t
bother
to
go
out
of
his
way
to
bring
a
great
performance
out
of
the
actors
and
he
did
this
because
he
is
at
hart
an
effects
man
he
loves
graphics
he
wanted
to
build
a
wonderful
and
complex
world
and
to
use
computer
graphics
to
create
a
visual
cinematic
experience
that
was
like
nothing
seen
before
and
he
did
that
and
brilliantly
but
in
his
rush
to
do
that
he
thought
he
could
get
away
with
neglecting
the
other
half
of
the
movie–the
story
that
ties
it
all
together
and
that’s
where
he
fell
apart
and
why
i
hate
the
first
trilogy
so
much
anakin’s
desperate
battle
against
fate
isn’t
the
problem
it’s
that
lucas
makes
him
act
so
insipid
and
stupid
that
the
audience
feels
he
turned
to
the
dark
side
because
he
was
a
whiny
manbitch
and
not
because
he
was
a
desperate
and
brilliant
jedi
who
was
at
heart
just
a
boy
trying
to
save
the
girl
he
loved
lucas
didn’t
treat
a
single
plot
idea
he
had
with
the
respect
it
deserved
and
he
(and
the
rest
of
us)
paid
for
it
james
h
i
like
your
alternative
it’s
a
bit
generic
(and
i
don’t
mean
that
in
a
rude
way)
and
predicated
on
the
idea
that
anakin
was
kind
of
rotten
to
begin
with
but
it’s
coherent
and
i
think
that
you’re
absolutely
right
that
it
would
have
made
a
good
framework
for
the
first
three
episodes
if
it
was
treated
properly
i
get
the
feeling
that
lucas
wanted
to
play
up
the
tragic
hero
angle
and
that’s
why
he
went
the
direction
he
did
but
i
do
disagree
with
you
about
one
strong
point
i
don’t
think
that
the
problem
with
star
wars
i
ii
and
iii
is
the
central
narrative
at
its
core
lucas’
script
for
episodes
i
ii
and
iii
is
very
much
the
same
as
your
own
it’s
coherent
and
understandable
and
could
serve
as
the
basis
for
a
great
film

only
if
treated
properly

about
it

i
really
like
the
three
old
movies
because
of
the
story
and
the
great
idea
but
what
captured
my
attention
in
the
star
wars
saga
was
exactly
what
isn’t
considered
so
good
the
action
although
it
does
not
fit
well
in
the
universe
of
star
wars
the
paper
of
the
action
in
the
new
trilogy
is
to
attract
the
new
audience
making
it
justified
and
what
sabotages
the
new
movies
is
the
numbers
of
details
that
were
tried
to
be
put
in
the
movie
because
of
the
lack
of
answers
in
the
old
trilogy
they
put
a
lot
of
details
because
they
needed
not
only
to
tell
a
new
story
but
to
explain
an
already
existed
one
this
makes
difficult
to
conceal
and
the
problems
are
seen
more
easily
as
a
17
years
old
nerd
i
would
put
the
films
in
this
order
worst

i
iii

v
vi
best
i
would
put
this
in
my
opinion
(that
nobody
needs
to
share
if
you
don’t
will
to)
because
of
the
action
involved
and
the
story
and
in
the
problems
in
the
story
appeared
not
only
in
the
new
trilogy
who
would
put
a
week
point
in
a
massive
weapon
like
the
death
star??
why
there
is
a
hole
that
take
it
to

doesn’t

any
of
you
seen
rotj
recently?
episode
iv
was
breathtaking
and
revolutionary
episode
v
picked
up
from
where
it
left
off
and
added
an
intensity
the
first
was
missing
and
delved
deeper
into
the
themes
and
characters
star
wars
created
then
episode
vi
came
along
and
fucked
everything
up
you’ve
done
an
excellent
job
of
explaining
why
episodes
iiii
are
unbearable
pieces
of
shit
so
why
omit
return
of
the
jedi?
that
movie
is
the
worst
of
the
ot
by
far
and
i’d
argue
the
worst
of
the
saga
the
only
reason
an
adult
would
enjoy
that
movie
is
if
they
saw
it
as
a
child
and
are
incapable
of
viewing
it
objectively
all
of
the
terrible
qualities
of
the
prequels
are
there
go
and
give
it
a
rewatch
i
implore
you
dan
i
think
the
worst
parts
are
the
endless
droning
on
in
luke
and
vader’s
lightsaber
battle
it
was
trying
to
build
suspense
but
it
just
got
boring
and
also
i
don’t
mind
the
ewoks
as
much
as
most
but
they
should
have
played
a
smaller
role
that
being
said
the
speeder
chase
in
the
forest
was
pretty
cool
and
what
you
said
about
seeing
it
as
a
kid
i
saw
both
the
old
trilogy
(on
vhs
not
the
shitty
remade
dvd’s)
and
the
prequels
as
a
kid
personally
i
think
that
people
give
the
prequels
too
much
shit
and
that
they
had
too
high
of
expectations
going
into
it
also
my
personal
favorite
is
esb
it
is
the
most
thoughtful
and
conflicted
one
halde
how
ironic
was
about
to
watch
this
when
i
see
a
clone
wars
animated
series
blueray
commercial
by
dvdoocom

guess
what
disney
is
dmcaing
next?
evan
you
were
very
biased
in

the
pod

bet
it
really
wasn’t

cthulhugamete
my
only
gripe
with
this
the
best
review
of
this
steaming
pile
of
shit
of
a
movie
is
mo
mention
of
kurosawa
godard
or
bergman

[
might
be
shy
an
italian
or
two
and
i
know
he’s
an
acquired
taste
but
esp
if
your
a
painter
–
greenaway’s
movies
are
a
visual
candy
shop
since
the
disney
buyout
and
discussions
about
the
next
possible
film
i’ve
encountered
some
“thru
the
eyes
of
a
child”
apologists
for
this
trope
fest
just
needed
a
reminder
that
i
wasn’t
losing
mind
this
is
a
terrible
movie
and
needs
to
be
remembered
as
such
besides
maul
the
only
redeeming
quality
of
pm
is
that
comparatively
it
makes
the
ewoks
bearable

*no
mention
of
kurosawa

i
think
i
recognized
the
sound
of
plinkett’s
‘gat’
as
one
of
the
weapons
from
the
old
star
wars
dark
forces
pc
game
back
in

alex
ok
so
the
blockade
“rings”
the
planet…
makes
a
ring
around
the
planet
(sorry
i’m
not
the
native
speaker)
and
as
far
as
i
understand
one
not
gives
a
shit
from
which
point
on
the
planet
they
take
off
cuz
in
space
there’s
no
ups
and
downs
so
why
to
go
directly
thought
the
blockade
ring??
go
above
it!
90
degrees
above
or
below
right
or
up
get
to
a
safe
distance
plot
your
course
“engage!”
no?
ok
shield
generator
it
is
then
guest
or
calculate
the
jump
to
hyperspace
from
inside
the
blockade
and
then
past
at
light
speed
piece
of
cake
jubalbiggs
one
of
the
best
movie
reviews
ever
made
now
if
you
would
only
break
prometheus
down…
all
the
way
to
the
mitochlorians
johnwaynman
yea
they
kind
of
had
step
1)
and
lots
of
step
3)
but
step
2)
was
mostly
skipped
which
essentially
made
them
a
bunch
of
mediocrity/awfulness
in
attractive
sugar
coating
sectoid55
“what’s
wrong
with
your
faaace?”
plinkett
needs
to
bring
that
back
in
another
review
alex
