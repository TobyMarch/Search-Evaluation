bee
gees
songs
in
memory
of
robin
gibb
daniel
s
levine
5/21/2012
it’s
awful
to
hear
the
news
that
robin
gibb
one
of
the
founding
members
of
the
bee
gees
has
died
robin’s
vocals
were
a
key
part
of
the
group
which
produced
some
of
the
most
beautiful
harmonies
ever
committed
to
record
the
group’s
influence
on
the
world
of
music
was
immense
we
all
know
their
disco
work
but
they
had
been
around
for
over
a
decade
before
“jive
talkin’”
ever
hit
the
airwaves
here’s
a
list
of
their
major
songs
and
a
few
personal
favorites
as
with
any
list
if
you
ask
me
tomorrow
this
will
probably
be
very
different
you
can
let
us
know
your
favorite
songs
in
the
comments

“this
is
where
i
came
in”

this
is
where
i
came
in
2001
this
is
where
i
came
in
was
the
group’s
last
album
recorded
shortly
before
maurice
robin’s
twin
brother
died
in
2003
the
title
track
was
also
released
as
a
single
and
features
a
fantastic
groove
that
harkens
back
to
their
great
mid’60s
records
robin’s
vocals
here
prove
that
he
never
lost
his
power
to
give
an
emotional
performance
9
“fanny
(be
tender
with
my
love)”

main
course
1975
it’s
really
insane
to
think
that
a
group
of
englishborn
australianraised
musicians
charged
the
course
of
music
history
by
making
disco
mainstream
their
three
disco
records
plus
the
songs
on
saturday
night
fever
is
one
of
the
most
stunning
streaks
of
success
in
music
history
“fanny
(be
tender
with
my
love)”
is
just
one
of
the
three
hits
on
main
course
but
is
a
favorite
of
mine
it’s
a
wonderful
track
with
that
perfect
blend
of
voices
that
was
so
unique
to
the
group
8
“spicks
and
specks”

spicks
and
specks
1966
by
the
time
they
released
bee
gees’
1st
worldwide
the
group
already
recorded
two
albums
in
australia
“spicks
and
specks”
was
the
single
that
gained
international
notice
it’s
primarily
a
barrydriven
track
with
the
oldest
brother
taking
lead
vocals
and
is
very
primitive
compared
to
their
later
work
but
it’s
still
a
great
slice
of
pop
7
“massachusetts”

horizontal
1967
“massachusetts”
was
the
group’s
first
uk
no
1
single
and
is
still
one
of
the
bestselling
singles
in
the
uk
of
all
time
if
this
is
the
track
that
acted
as
an
introduction
to
the
group
for
some
they
couldn’t
have
asked
for
a
better
intro
robin’s
vocal
is
perfect
i
love
it
when
they
sing
“and
the
lights
all
went
down
in
massachusetts/the
day
i
left
her
standing
on
her
own”
6
“too
much
heaven”

spirits
having
flown
1979
spirits
having
flown
is
such
a
fantastic
record
from
top
to
bottom

especially
from
the
top
the
album’s
first
three
tracks
all
reached
no
1
on
billboard
“too
much
heaven”
was
written
for
unicef
and
was
released
a
few
months
before
the
rest
of
the
album
still
it
features
the
group’s
massive
overdubbing
addiction
(is
that
a
thing?)
which
makes
the
three
members
of
the
group
sound
like
a
choir
5
“melody
fair”

odessa
1969
odessa
is
the
bee
gees’
white
album
a
double
lp
filled
with
tracks
that
cover
so
many
genres
it
makes
the
mind
boggle
it
wasn’t
as
successful
as
the
beatles’
seminal
album
but
it
features
some
fantastic
tracks
including
“melody
fair”
4
“jive
talkin’”

main
course
1975
to
me
“jive
talkin’”
is
the
bee
gees
telling
the
world
“hey
we’re
still
here
and
we
still
write
songs
better
than
anyone
else!”
the
track
which
kicks
off
with
that
deep
beat
was
released
after
years
of
flops
and
suddenly
made
the
group
relevant
again
it
proved
so
popular
that
it
was
included
on
the
saturday
night
fever
soundtrackeven
though
it
is
never
heard
in
the
film!

“you
should
be
dancing”

children
of
the
world
1976
“you
should
be
dancing”
was
in
saturday
night
fever
after
it
was
issued
as
a
single
and
acted
as
the
leadoff
track
to
children
of
the
world
it
features
stunning
vocals
and
amazing
production
it’s
hard
not
to
want
to
get
up
and
dance
every
time
you
hear
it
2
“stayin’
alive”

saturday
night
fever
1977
it’s
not
my
favorite
bee
gees
song
but
people
love
it
and
it
continues
to
get
airtime
decades
since
disco
fell
out
of
popularity
the
video
of
the
group
walking
to
the
song
remains
immortal
(the
video
i’ve
included
here
has
been
viewed
over
14
million
times
since
the
group’s
label
posted
it
in
2009)
it
seems
to
encapsulate
an
entire
genre
in
one
song
1
“how
can
you
mend
a
broken
heart”

trafalgar
1971
four
minutes
of
perfection
it
just
doesn’t
get
any
better
than
this
my
favorite
song
by
the
group
is
either
this
or
“to
love
somebody”
but
i’ll
pick
this
one
for
robin’s
amazing
vocal
on
the
first
verse
the
track
slowly
builds

it
feels
more
like
a
march
than
a
traditional
song

with
all
three
brothers
coming
together
for
the
final
verse
honorable
mention
“saved
by
the
bell”

robin’s
reign
1970
robin
actually
left
the
group
in
1969
leaving
barry
and
maurice
to
record
an
album
by
themselves
this
track
was
the
single
from
robin’s
album
