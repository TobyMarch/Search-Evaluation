“the
whole
thing
is
utterly
impossible
and
utterly
fascinating
it
is
the
most
baffling
mystery
agatha
christie
has
ever
written”
(new
york
times
)
“one
of
the
most
ingenious
thrillers
in
many
a
day”
(time
magazine
)
“one
of
the
very
best
most
genuinely
bewildering
christies”
(the
observer
(uk)
)
“there
is
no
cheating
the
reader
is
just
bamboozled
in
a
straightforward
way
from
first
to
last…the
most
colossal
achievement
of
a
colossal
career
the
book
must
rank
with
mrs
christie’s
previous
best—on
the
top
notch
of
detection”
(new

)
“the
most
astonishingly
impudent
ingenious
and
altogether
successful
mystery
story
since
the
murder
of
roger
ackroyd”
(daily

)
“what
agatha
christie
taught
me
was
all
about
the
delicate
placement
of
the
red
herring
she
was
the
ultimate
genius
behind
‘by
indirections

christie's
and
then
there
were
none
should
be
very
close
to
the
top
of
any
mystery
fan's
must
read
list
the
novel
concerns
a
group
of
ten
previously
unacquainted
people
who
are
lured
via
various
pretexts
to
indian
island
a
resort
home
off
the
coast
of
devonand
are
promptly
accused
by
their
unseen
host
of
having
escaped
punishment
for
past
crimes
cut
off
from
the
world
and
fighting
rising
panic
they
scramble
to
unmask
the
killer
even
as
their
number
is
reduced
in
macabre
accordance
with
the
ten
little
indians
nursey
rhyme
displayed
in
rooms
throughout
the
house
agatha
christie
was
already
famous
when
and
then
there
were
none
(also
known
under
the
title
ten
little
indians)
was
publishedbut
this
book
put
her
career
well
over
the
top
nothing
like
it
had
seen
before
it
proved
a
sensation
and
writers
and
filmmakers
continue
to
use
christie's
basic
idea
to
this
very
day
some
critics
argue
the
novel
is
mechanical
rather
than
organic
but
i
say
if
this
is
mechanical
let's
have
more
of
it!
it
is
truly
a
can'tputitdown
nonstop
read
a
spectacular
turn
by
the
genre's
single
most
celebrated
author
the
success
of
the
novel
inspired
christie
to
adapt
it
for
the
stage
where
it
was
a
tremendous
success
and
there
have
been
several
film
versions
(most
notably
the
1940s
rene
clairdirected
and
then
there
were
none)
over
the
years
if
you
know
the
story
only
from
stage
and
film
versions
however
you
are
in
for
a
surprise
christie
felt
the
novel's
conclusion
did
not
translate
well
to
the
stage
so
she
rewrote
itand
most
film
versions
follow
the
stage
script
not
the
novel
but
whether
you've
seen
the
play
and
films
or
not
get
ready
for
a
shock!

paperback
dame
agatha
makes
a
jarring
departure
in
this
grim
and
intricate
tale
there
is
no
sleuth
the
pace
is
fast
frenzied
and
breathless
and
rather
than
types
she
takes
pains
with
characterizations
the
body
count
is
high
and
the
mode
of
death
frequently
untidy
and
then
there
were
none
is
among
the
most
favored
of
christie's
books
it
has
gone
through
a
few
title
changes
i
knew
it
as
ten
little
indians
and
before
that
it
had
even
a
more
politically
incorrect
title
be
forewarned
ms
christie
is
neither
enlightened
nor
tolerant
some
of
the
passages
and
references
are
bigoted
and
might
offend
some
readers
a
group
of
ten
strangers
is
invited
or
hired
for
a
long
weekend
on
indian
island
a
mile
off
the
devon
coast
it
is
somewhat
improbable
that
these
ten
would
all
accept
such
a
vague
invitation
from
a
host
they
do
not
know
to
a
place
they
have
never
seen
before
but
each
for
his
or
her
own
reasons
accepts
they
include
a
doctor
a
games
mistress
a
soldier
of
fortune
a
rich
playboy
a
retired
policeman
a
judge
a
spinster
a
retired
general
and
a
married
couple
who
are
to
be
the
servants
they
arrive
on
a
bleak
rocky
island
to
a
completely
modern
house
with
all
the
amenities
the
fires
are
welcoming
there
is
an
ample
supply
of
food
the
servants
are
impeccable
but
their
host
is
absent
in
each
of
the
bedrooms
the
ten
little
indians
nursery
rhyme
is
posted
on
a
prominent
wall
it
begins
ten
little
indian
boys
went
out
to
dine
one
choked
his
little
self
and
then
there
were
nine
drinks
are
served
and
one
guest
chokes
turns
blue
and
falls
over
dead
the
tension
builds
the
fright
of
the
stranded
people
is
palpable
as
one
by
one
they
are
picked
off
each
in
accordance
with
the
nursery
rhyme
as
the
number
of
victims
increase
the
survivors'
suspicions
of
each
other
reach
a
frantic
pitch
in
an
epilogue
the
police
arrive
and
find
them
all
dead
who
is
the
murderer
who
has
to
be
among
the
victims?
and
then
there
were
none
is
told
in
short
choppy
chapters
that
build
suspense
and
tension
i
would
call
this
christie's
one
and
only
thriller
none
of
the
characters
are
even
likable
and
once
again
(see
abc
murders)
christie
toys
with
the
idea
of
the
serial
killer
long
before
such
an
animal
was
even
heard
of
she
is
a
good
profiler
too!
this
is
an
excellent
story
and
the
author
is
miles
ahead
of
you
at
all
times
if
you
can
figure
out
who
and
how
before
she
lays
it
out
for
you
you
deserve
the
sleuth
of
the
year
award!

perhaps
one
of
the
greatest
mysteries
ever
written
march

1999
by
a
customer
formatmass
market
paperback
set
on
an
isolated
island
without
contact
of
the
outside
civilization
agatha
christie's
novel
and
then
there
were
none
is
the
story
of
tem
strangers
invited
to
an
island
by
a
mysterious
host
the
book
starts
out
with
an
introduction
to
the
ten
characters
although
this
is
effective
in
telling
the
characters
it
is
also
boring
and
does
not
catch
your
attention
right
away
but
as
soon
as
the
guests
arrive
on
indian
island
this
boredom
disperses
and
an
exciting
thriller
breaks
through
what
is
also
exciting
about
this
novel
is
you
have
no
idea
who
is
committing
these
strange
murders
the
first
night
these
people
are
at
the
house
they
are
greeted
with
an
eerie
voice
that
accuses
them
of
murders
that
were
committed
but
were
never
convicted
of
in
the
past
when
the
guests
arrive
there
is
no
trace
of
un
owen
but
as
the
guests
start
to
die
this
mysterious
figure
reveals
his
ugly
face
this
book
shows
fear
in
peoples
conciences
the
guilt
that
lies
within
and
the
hate
among
strangers
anyone
who
wants
to
read
a
suspenseful
murder
mystery
and
wamts
to
stay
on
the
end
of
their
seats
should
read
this
wicked
novel
of
horror
and
fear
