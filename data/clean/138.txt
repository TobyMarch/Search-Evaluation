john
lennon
then
aged
sixteen
formed
a
skiffle
group
with
several
friends
from
quarry
bank
school
they
briefly
called
themselves
the
blackjacks
before
changing
their
name
to
the
quarrymen
after
discovering
that
a
respected
local
group
was
already
using
the
name[3]
fifteenyearold
paul
mccartney
joined
as
a
rhythm
guitarist
shortly
after
he
and
lennon
met
that
july[4]
in
february
1958
mccartney
invited
his
friend
george
harrison
to
watch
the
group
the
fourteenyearold
auditioned
for
lennon
impressing
him
with
his
playing
but
lennon
initially
thought
harrison
too
young
for
the
band
after
a
month
of
persistence
harrison
joined
as
lead
guitarist[5][6]
by
january
1959
lennon's
quarry
bank
friends
had
left
the
group
and
he
began
studies
at
the
liverpool
college
of
art[7]
the
three
guitarists
billing
themselves
at
least
three
times
as
johnny
and
the
moondogs[8]
were
playing
rock
and
roll
whenever
they
could
find
a
drummer[9]
lennon's
art
school
friend
stu
sutcliffe
who
had
recently
sold
one
of
his
paintings
and
purchased
a
bass
guitar
joined
in
january
1960
and
it
was
he
who
suggested
changing
the
band's
name
to
beatals
as
a
tribute
to
buddy
holly
and
the
crickets[10]
they
used
the
name
through
may
when
they
became
the
silver
beetles
before
undertaking
a
brief
tour
of
scotland
as
the
backing
group
for
pop
singer
and
fellow
liverpudlian
johnny
gentle
by
early
july
they
changed
their
name
to
the
silver
beatles
and
by
the
middle
of
august
to
the
beatles[11]
their
lack
of
a
fulltime
drummer
posed
a
problem
when
the
group's
unofficial
manager
allan
williams
arranged
a
resident
band
booking
for
them
in
hamburg
germany
so
in
midaugust
they
auditioned
and
hired
pete
best
the
band
now
a
fivepiece
left
four
days
later
contracted
to
club
owner
bruno
koschmider
for
what
would
be
a
3&frac12month
residency[12]
beatles'
historian
mark
lewisohn
wrote
they
pulled
into
hamburg
at
dusk
on
17
august
the
time
when
the
redlight
area
comes
to
life

flashing
neon
lights
screamed
out
the
various
entertainment
on
offer
while
scantily
clad
women
sat
unabashed
in
shop
windows
waiting
for
business
opportunities[13]
koschmider
had
converted
a
couple
of
strip
clubs
in
the
district
into
music
venues
and
he
initially
placed
the
group
at
the
indra
club
after
closing
the
indra
due
to
noise
complaints
he
moved
them
to
the
kaiserkeller
in
october[14]
when
he
learned
they
had
been
performing
at
the
rival
top
ten
club
in
breach
of
their
contract
he
gave
the
band
one
month's
termination
notice[15]
and
reported
the
underage
harrison
who
had
obtained
permission
to
stay
in
hamburg
by
lying
to
the
german
authorities
about
his
age[16]
the
authorities
arranged
for
harrison's
deportation
in
late
november[17]
one
week
later
koschmider
had
mccartney
and
best
arrested
for
arson
after
they
set
fire
to
a
tapestry
on
the
wall
in
their
room
the
authorities
deported
them[18]
lennon
returned
to
liverpool
in
early
december
while
sutcliffe
remained
in
hamburg
through
late
february
with
his
german
fianc&eacutee
astrid
kirchherr[19]
who
took
the
first
semiprofessional
photos
of
the
band
members[20]
during
the
next
two
years
the
group
were
resident
for
periods
in
hamburg
where
they
used
preludin
both
recreationally
and
to
maintain
their
energy
through
allnight
performances[21]
in
1961
during
their
second
hamburg
engagement
kirchherr
cut
sutcliffe's
hair
in
the
exi
(existentialist)
style
later
adopted
by
the
other
beatles[22][23]
when
sutcliffe
decided
to
leave
the
band
early
that
year
and
resume
his
art
studies
in
germany
mccartney
took
up
the
bass[24]
producer
bert
kaempfert
contracted
what
was
now
a
fourpiece
group
through
june
1962
and
he
used
them
as
tony

backing

months
later

number
32
on
the

chart[26]
after
completing
their
second
hamburg
residency
the
band
enjoyed
increasing
popularity
in
liverpool
particularly
in
merseyside
with
the
growing
merseybeat
movement
however
they
were
also
growing
tired
of
the
monotony
of
numerous
appearances
at
the
same
clubs
night
after
night[27]
in
november
during
one
of
the
group's
frequent
appearances
at
the
cavern
club
they
encountered
brian
epstein
a
local
record
store
owner
and
music
columnist[28]
he
later
recalled
i
immediately
liked
what
i
heard
they
were
fresh
and
they
were
honest
and
they
had
what
i
thought
was
a
sort
of
presence

[a]
star
quality[29]
epstein
courted
the
band
over
the
next
couple
of
months
and
they
appointed
him
manager
in
january
1962[30]
throughout
the
winter
and
spring
he
sought
to
free
them
from
their
contractual
obligations
to
bert

rejected

tragedy
greeted
them
upon
their
return
to
germany
in
april
when
a
distraught
kirchherr
met
them
at
the
airport
with
news
of
sutcliffe's
death
the
previous
day
from
what
would
later
be
determined
a
brain
haemorrhage[33]
the
following
month

the
beatles'
first
recording
session
under
martin's
direction
took
place
at
emi's
abbey
road
studios
in
london
on
6
june
1962[34]
martin
immediately
complained
to
epstein
about
best's
poor
drumming
and
suggested
they
use
a
session
drummer
in
his
stead[35]
the
beatles
already
contemplating
best's
dismissal[36]
replaced
him
in
midaugust
with
ringo
starr
who
left
rory
storm
and
the
hurricanes
to
join
them[34]
a
4
september
session
at
emi
yielded
a
recording
of
love

featuring
starr
on
drums
but
a
dissatisfied
martin
hired
drummer
andy
white
for
the
band's
third
session
a
week
later
which
produced
recordings
of
love
me
do
please
please
me
and
ps
i
love
you[34]
martin
initially
selected
the
starr
version
of
love
me
do
for
the
band's
first
single
though
subsequent
repressings
featured
the
white
version
with
starr
on
tambourine[34]
released
in
early
october
love

peaked
at
number
seventeen
on
the

that

with
a
live
performance
on

news
programme

a
studio
session
in
late

accurately
predicted

in

1962
the
band
concluded
their
fifth
and
final
hamburg
residency[41]
by
1963
the
beatles
had
agreed
that
all
four
members
would
contribute
vocals
to
their
albums—including
starr
despite
his
restricted
vocal
range
to
validate
his
standing
in
the
group[42]
lennon
and
mccartney
had
established
a
songwriting
partnership
and
as
the
band's
success
grew
their
dominant
collaboration
limited
harrison's
opportunities
as
a
lead
vocalist[43]
epstein
in
an
effort
to
maximize
the
beatles'
commercial
potential
encouraged
them
to
adopt
a
professional
approach
to
performing[44]
lennon
recalled
him
saying
look
if
you
really
want
to
get
in
these
bigger
places
you're
going
to
have
to
change—stop
eating
on
stage
stop
swearing
stop
smoking[45]
lennon
said
we
used
to
dress
how
we
liked
on
and
off
stage
he'd
tell
us
that
jeans
were
not
particularly
smart
and
could
we
possibly
manage
to
wear
proper
trousers
but
he
didn't
want
us
suddenly
looking
square
he'd
let
us
have
our
own
sense
of
individuality[45]

originally

were

he
elected
to

in
a

stephen

erlewine
comments
decades
after
its
release
the
album
still
sounds
fresh
precisely
because
of
its
intense
origins[48]
lennon
said
little
thought
went
into
composition
at
the
time
he
and
mccartney
were
just
writing
songs
&agrave
la
everly
brothers
&agrave
la
buddy
holly
pop
songs
with
no
more
thought
of
them
than
that—to
create
a
sound
and
the
words
were
almost
irrelevant[49]
their
logo
was
based
on
an
impromptu
sketch
by
instrument
retailer
and
designer
ivor
arbiter[50]
released
in
march
1963
the
album
initiated
a
run
during
which
eleven
of
their
twelve
studio
albums
released
in
the
united
kingdom
through
1970
reached
number
one[51]
the
band's
third
single
from
me
to
you
came
out
in
april
and
was
also
a
charttopping
hit
starting
an
almost
unbroken
string
of
seventeen
british
number
one
singles
for
the
band
including
all
but
one
of
the
eighteen
they
released
over
the
next
six
years[52]
released
in
august
the
band's
fourth
single
she

the
fastest
sales
of
any
record
in
the
uk
up
to
that
time
selling
threequarters
of
a
million
copies
in
under
four
weeks[53]
it
became
their
first
single
to
sell
a
million
copies
and
remained
the
biggestselling
record
in
the
uk
until
1978
when
mull
of
kintyre
by
mccartney's
postbeatles
band
wings
surpassed
it
in
sales[54]
their
popularity
brought
increasing
press
attention
to
which
the
beatles
responded
with
an
irreverent
and
comical
attitude
that
defied
the
expectations
of
pop
musicians
at
the
time
inspiring
even
more
interest[55]

style
contrasted
with

veritable
'teenyboppers'—kids
in

whose
lives
were
totally
wrapped
up
in
the
commercialized
popular
culture

the

posed
to
the

efforts
lennon
admitted
material's
becoming
a
hell
of
a
problem[104]
as
a
result
six
covers
from
their
extensive
repertoire
were
chosen
to
complete
the

fantastic
i

pretty
stunned
for

two[105]
he
and

subsequently
became
regular

mccartney
was
initially
reluctant
to
try
it
but
eventually
did
so
in
late
1966[106]
he
became
the
first
beatle
to
discuss
lsd
publicly
declaring
in

that
it
opened
my
eyes

made
me
a

elizabeth

british
empire
(mbe)
after

nominated
them
for

it
was
fun
but
basically
as
an
idea
for
a
film
it
was
a
bit
wrong[111]
the

was
dominated
by
lennon
who
wrote

most
of
its
songs

the
two

the

expanded

the

unintentionally
snubbed
the
nation's
first
lady
imelda
marcos
who
had
expected
them
to
attend
a
breakfast
reception
at
the
presidential
palace[138]
when
presented
with
the
invitation
epstein
politely
declined
on
the
band
members'
behalf
as
it
had
never
been
his
policy
to
accept
such
official
invitations[139]
they
soon
found
that
the
marcos
regime
was
unaccustomed
to
taking
no
for
an
answer
the
resulting
riots
endangered
the
group
and
they
escaped
the
country
with
difficulty[140]
immediately
afterward
the
band
members
visited
india
for
the
first
time[141]
almost
as
soon
as
they
returned
home
they
faced
a
fierce
backlash
from
us
religious
and
social
conservatives
(as
well
as
the
ku
klux
klan)
over
a
comment
lennon
had
made
in
a
march
interview
with
british
reporter
maureen
cleave[142]
christianity

go
lennon
said
it
will
vanish
and

i
needn't
argue
about
that
i'm

i
will
be

were

it's
them
twisting

that
ruins
it
for
me[143]
the
comment
went
virtually
unnoticed
in
england
but
when
us
teenage
fan
magazine
datebook
printed
it
five
months
later—on
the
eve
of
the
group's
august
us
tour—it
sparked
a
controversy
with
christians
in
the
american
bible
belt[144]
the
vatican
issued
a
protest
and
bans
on
beatles'
records
were
imposed
by
spanish
and
dutch
stations
and
south
africa's
national
broadcasting
service[145]
epstein
accused
datebook
of
having
taken
lennon's
words
out
of
context
at
a
press
conference
lennon
pointed
out
if
i'd
said
television
was
more
popular
than
jesus
i
might
have
got
away
with
it[146]
lennon
claimed
he
was
referring
to
how
other
people
viewed
their
success
but
at
the
prompting
of
reporters
he
concluded
if
you
want
me
to
apologise
if
that
will
make
you
happy
then
okay
i'm
sorry[146]
as
preparations
were
made
for
the

the

knew
that

acquired

these
were
still
inadequate
struggling
to

with

the

had

an

then
perform

originally

a

it
was
a
time
when

between
the

were
at

he
also
demanded
they
cease
work
at
twickenham
and
relocate
to
the
newly
finished
apple
studios
the
other
band
members
agreed
and
the
idea
came
about
to
salvage
the
footage
shot
for
the
tv
production
for
use
in
a
feature
film[218]
in
an
effort
to
alleviate
tensions
within
the

and
improve
the
quality
of
their
live
sound
harrison
invited
keyboardist
billy
preston
to
participate
in

days
of

preston
received

billing
on
the

only
musician
ever
to
receive
that
acknowledgment
on
an
official
beatles
release[220]
at
the
conclusion
of
the
rehearsals
the
band
could
not
agree
on
a
location
to
film

rejecting
several
ideas
including
a
boat
at

a
lunatic

was

rejected

of

piece
of

wanted

the

format
with

everett
describes
lennon

mccartney's
contrasting
motivations
and
approaches
to
composition
mccartney
may
be
said
to
have
constantly
developed—as
a
means
to
entertain—a
focused
musical
talent
with
an
ear
for
counterpoint
and
other
aspects
of
craft
in
the
demonstration
of
a
universally
agreedupon
common
language
that
he
did
much
to
enrich
conversely
lennon's
mature
music
is
best
appreciated
as
the
daring
product
of
a
largely
unconscious
searching
but
undisciplined
artistic
sensibility[295]
ian
macdonald
comparing
the
two
composers
in
revolution
in
the
head
describes
mccartney
as
a
natural
melodist—a
creator
of
tunes
capable
of
existing
apart
from
their
harmony
his
melody
lines
are
characterized
as
primarily
vertical
employing
wide
consonant
intervals
which
express
his
extrovert
energy
and
optimism
conversely
lennon's
sedentary
ironic
personality
is
reflected
in
a
horizontal
approach
featuring
minimal
dissonant
intervals
and
repetitive
melodies
which
rely
on
their
harmonic
accompaniment
for
interest
basically
a
realist
he
instinctively
kept
his
melodies
close
to
the
rhythms
and
cadences
of
speech
colouring
his
lyrics
with
bluesy
tone
and
harmony
rather
than
creating
tunes
that
made
striking
shapes
of
their
own[296]
macdonald
praises
harrison's
lead
guitar
work

the

his
characterful
lines

author
dominic
pedler
describes
the
way
they
crossed
genres
one
of
[their]
greatest

achievements
was
the
songwriting
juggling
act
they
managed
for
most
of
their
career
far
from
moving
sequentially
from
one
genre
to
another
(as
is
sometimes
conveniently
suggested)
the
group
maintained
in
parallel
their
mastery
of
the
traditional
catchy
chart
hit
while
simultaneously
forging
rock
and
dabbling
with
a
wide
range
of
peripheral
influences
from
country
to
vaudeville
one
of
these
threads
was
their
take
on
folk
music
which
would
form
such
essential
groundwork
for
their
later
collisions
with
indian
music
and
philosophy[317]
as
the
personal
relationships
between
the
band
members
grew
increasingly
strained
their
individual
tastes
became
more
apparent

made
him

martin
suggested
to
a
sceptical
mccartney
that
the

accompaniment
thereby
introducing
the

members
to
a
hitherto
unsuspected
world
of
classical
instrumental
colour
in
macdonald's
description[320]
the

creative
development
was
also
facilitated
by

willingness
to
experiment
in
response
to
their
suggestions
such
as
adding
something
baroque
to
a
particular
recording[321]

as

arrangements
for
recordings
martin
often
performed
playing
instruments
including
piano
organ

challenge
of
catering
to
lennon's
intuitive
approach
generally
spurred
him
to
his
more
original
arrangements
of
which
'being
for
the
benefit
of
mr
kite!'
is
an
outstanding
example[323]
martin
said
of
the
two
composers'
distinct
songwriting
styles
and
his
own
stabilizing
influence
compared
with
paul's
songs
all
of
which
seemed
to
keep
in
some
sort
of
touch
with
reality
john's
had
a
psychedelic
almost
mystical
quality

john's
imagery
is
one
of
the
best
things
about
his
work&nbsp–
'tangerine
trees'
'marmalade
skies'
'cellophane
flowers'

i
always
saw
him
as
an
aural
salvador
dal&iacute
rather
than
some
drugridden
record
artist
on
the
other
hand
i
would
be
stupid
to
pretend
that
drugs
didn't
figure
quite
heavily
in
the
beatles'
lives
at
that
time

they
knew
that
i
in
my
schoolmasterly
role
didn't
approve

not
only
was
i
not
into
it
myself
i
couldn't
see
the
need
for
it
and
there's
no
doubt
that
if
i
too
had
been
on
dope
pepper
would
never
have
been
the
album
it
was
perhaps
it
was
the
combination
of
dope
and
no
dope
that
worked
who
knows?[324]
harrison
echoed
martin's
description
of
his
stabilizing
role
i
think
we
just
grew
through
those
years
together
him
as
the
straight
man
and
us
as
the
loonies
but
he
was
always
there
for
us
to
interpret
our
madness—we
used
to
be
slightly
avantgarde
on
certain
days
of
the
week
and
he
would
be
there
as
the
anchor
person
to
communicate
that
through
the
engineers
and
on
to
the
tape[325]
in
the
studio
see
also
the
beatles'
recording
technology
the
beatles
made
innovative
use
of
technology
expanding
the
possibilities
of
recorded
music
they
urged
experimentation
by
martin
and
his
recording
engineers
while
seeking
ways
to
put
chance
occurrences
to
creative
use
accidental
guitar
feedback
a
resonating
glass
bottle
a
tape
loaded
the
wrong
way
round
so
that
it
played
backwards—any
of
these
might
be
incorporated
into
their
music[326]
their
desire
to
create
new
sounds
on
every
new
recording
combined
with
martin's
arranging
abilities
and
the
studio
expertise
of
emi
staff
engineers
norman
smith
ken
townsend
and
emerick
all
contributed
significantly
to
their
records
from
rubber
soul
and
especially
revolver
forward[326]
along
with
innovative
studio
techniques
such
as
sound
effects
unconventional
microphone
placements
tape
loops
double
tracking
and
varispeed
recording
they
augmented
their
songs
with
instruments
that
were
unconventional
in
rock
music
at
the
time
these
included
string
and
brass
ensembles
as
well
as
indian
instruments
such
as
the
sitar
in
norwegian
wood
(this
bird
has
flown)
and
the
swarmandal
in
strawberry
fields
forever[327]
they
also
used
early
electronic
instruments
such
as
the
mellotron
with
which
mccartney
supplied
the
flute
voices
on
the
strawberry
fields
intro[328]
and
the
clavioline
an
electronic
keyboard
that
created
the
unusual
oboelike
sound
on
baby
you're

the

experienced
its

fans

observers
as
an
embodiment

according
to
peter
lavezzoli
after
the

work
out
a

with
a
consortium
of
london
brokerage
firms
that
had
accumulated
a
14%
holding[357]
the
deal
collapsed
over
the
objections
of

declared
i'm

controlling
nearly
the

lennon–mccartney
catalog
as
well
as
any

material
until
1973[359]
in
frustration
lennon
and
mccartney
sold
their
shares
to
atv
in
late
october
1969[360]
in
1981
financial
losses

rupert
perry
grade
contacted
mccartney
offering
atv
music
and
northern
songs
for
$30
million[361]
according
to
an
account
mccartney
gave
in
1995
he
met
with
grade
and
explained
he
was
interested
solely
in
the
northern
songs
catalog
if
grade
were
ever
willing
to
separate
off
that
portion
of
atv
music
soon
after
grade
offered
to
sell
him
northern
songs
for
&pound20
million
giving
the
exbeatle
a
week
or
so
to
decide
by
mccartney's
account
he
and
ono
countered
with
a
&pound5
million
bid
that
was
rejected[362]
according
to
reports
at
the
time
grade
refused
to
separate
northern
songs
and
turned
down
an
offer
of
&pound21–&pound25
million
from
mccartney
and

for
&pound60
million[363]
three
years
later
michael
jackson
purchased
atv
for
a
reported
$475
million
the
acquisition
gave
jackson
control
over
the
publishing
rights
to
more
than
200
beatles
songs
as
well
as
40000
other
copyrights[364]
in
1995
in
a
deal
that
earned
him
a
reported
$110
million
jackson
merged
his
music
publishing
business
with
sony
creating
a
new
company
sony/atv
music
publishing
in
which
he
held
a
50%
stake
the
merger
made
the
new
company
then
valued
at
over
half
a
billion
dollars
the
third
largest
music
publisher
in
the
world[365]
despite
the
lack
of
publishing
rights
to
most
of
their

lennon's

mccartney
continue
to

33⅓%
