showing
floral
tributes
after
his
death
michael
jackson
was
born
on
august
29
1958
the
eighth
of
ten
children
in
an
african
american
workingclass
family
who
lived
in
a
small
3room
house
in
gary
indiana[7]
an
industrial
city
near
chicago
his
mother
katherine
esther
scruse
was
a
devout
jehovah's
witness
and
his
father
joseph
walter
joe
jackson
was
a
steel
mill
worker
who
performed
with
an
rb
band
called
the
falcons
jackson
had
three
sisters
rebbie
la
toya
and
janet
and
five
brothers
jackie
tito
jermaine
marlon
and
randy[8]
a
sixth
brother
brandon
died
shortly
after
birth[9]
jackson
had
a
troubled
relationship
with
his
father
joe[10][11][12]
joseph
acknowledged
in
2003
that
he
regularly
whipped
jackson
as
a
boy[12]
jackson
stated
that
he
was
physically
and
emotionally
abused
during
incessant
rehearsals
though
he
also
credited
his
father's
strict
discipline
with
playing
a
large
role
in
his
success[10]
jackson
first
spoke
openly
about
his
childhood
abuse
in
an
interview
with
oprah
winfrey
broadcast
in
february
1993
he
admitted
that
he
had
often
cried
from
loneliness
and
he
would
vomit
on
the
sight
of
his
father
jackson's
father
was
also
said
to
have
verbally
abused
jackson
saying
that
he
had
a
fat
nose
on
numerous
occasions[13]
in
fact
michael
jackson's
deep
dissatisfaction
with
his
appearance
his
nightmares
and
chronic
sleep
problems
his
tendency
to
remain
hypercompliant
especially
with
his
father
and
to
remain
childlike
throughout
his
adult
life
are
in
many
ways
consistent
with
the
effects
of
this
chronic
maltreatment
he
endured
as
a
young
child[14]
in
an
interview
with
martin
bashir
later
included
in
the
2003
broadcast
of
living
with
michael
jackson
jackson
acknowledged
that
his
father
hurt
him
when
he
was
a
child
but
was
nonetheless
a
genius
as
he
admitted
his
father's
strict
discipline
played
a
huge
role
in
his
success
when
bashir
dismissed
the
positive
remark
and
continued
asking
about
beatings
jackson
put
his
hand
over
his
face
and
objected
to
the
questions
he
recalled
that
joseph
sat
in
a
chair
with
a
belt
in
his
hand
as
he
and
his
siblings
rehearsed
and
that
if
you
didn't
do
it
the
right
way
he
would
tear
you
up
really
get
you[15][16]

after
working
with
paul

in

jackson
had
learned
mccartney
made
approximately
$40&nbspmillion
a
year
from
other
people's
songs[58]
in
1981[59]
mccartney
was
offered
the

catalog
for
&pound20
million
($40
million)[58][60]
according
to
mccartney
he
contacted
yoko
ono
about
making
a
joint
purchase
by
splitting
the
cost
equally
at
&pound10
million
each
but
ono
thought
they
could
buy
it
for

each[58][60]
when
they
were
unable
to
make
the
joint
purchase
mccartney
let
the
offer
fall
through
not
wanting
to
be
the
sole
owner
of
the
beatles'
songs[59][60]
according
to
a
negotiator
for
holmes
&agrave
court
in
the
1984
sale
we
had
given
paul
mccartney
first
right
of
refusal
but
paul
didn't
want
it
at
that
time[61]
also
an
attorney
for
mccartney
assured
jackson's
attorney
john
branca
that
mccartney
was
not
interested
in
bidding
mccartney
reportedly
said
it's
too
pricey[58][59]
but
there
were
several
other
companies
and
investors
bidding
in
september
1984
jackson
was
first
informed
about
the
sale
by
branca
and
sent
a
bid
of
$46
million
on
november
20
1984[57]
jackson's
agents
thought
they
had
a
deal
several
times
but
encountered
new
bidders
or
new
areas
of
debate[57]
in
may
1985
jackson's
team
walked
away
from
talks
after
having
spent
over
$1
million
on
four
months
of
due
diligence
and
on
the
negotiations[57]
in
june
1985
jackson
and
branca
learned
that
charles

the

co
had
made
a
tentative
agreement
with

but
in

august
holmes
&agrave
court's
team
contacted
jackson
and

resumed
jackson
raised
his
bid
to
$475

and
it
was
accepted
because
he
could
close
the

more
quickly
having
already

and
appearance
jackson's
skin
had
been
a
mediumbrown
color
for
the
entire
duration
of
his
youth
but
starting
in
the
mid1980s
it
gradually
grew
paler
the
change
gained
widespread
media
coverage
including
rumors
that
he
might
be
bleaching
his
skin[62]
according
to
j
randy
taraborrelli's
biography
in
1986
jackson
was
diagnosed
with
vitiligo
and
lupus
the
vitiligo
partially
lightened
his
skin
and
the
lupus
was
in
remission
both
illnesses
made
him
sensitive
to
sunlight
the
treatments
he
used
for
his
condition
further
lightened
his
skin
tone
and
with
the
application
of
pancake
makeup
to
even
out
blotches
he
could
appear
very
pale[63]
jackson
was
also
diagnosed
with
vitiligo
in
his
autopsy[64]
by
the
mid1990s
several
surgeons
speculated
that
he
had
undergone
various
nasal
surgeries
a
forehead
lift
thinned
lips
and
cheekbone
surgery—although
jackson
denied
this
and
insisted
that
he
only
had
surgery
on
his
nose[65]
jackson
claimed
that
he
had
only
two
rhinoplasties
and
no
other
surgery
on
his
face
although
at
one
point
he
mentioned
having
a
dimple
created
in
his
chin[66]
jackson
lost
weight
in
the
early
1980s
because
of
a
change
in
diet
and
a
desire
for
a
dancer's
body[66]
witnesses
reported
that
he
was
often
dizzy
and
speculated
that
he
was
suffering
from
anorexia
nervosa
periods
of
weight
loss
would
become
a
recurring
problem
later
in
life[67]
during
the
course
of
his
treatment
jackson
made
two
close
friends
his
dermatologist
dr
arnold
klein
and
klein's
nurse
debbie
rowe
rowe
eventually
became
jackson's
second
wife
and
the
mother
of
his
two
eldest
children
he
also
relied
heavily
on
klein
for
medical
and
business
advice[68]
jackson
became
the
subject
of
increasingly
sensational
reports
in
1986
the
tabloids
ran
a
story
claiming
that
jackson
slept
in
a
hyperbaric
oxygen
chamber
to
slow
the
aging
process
he
was
pictured
lying
down
in
a
glass
box
although
the
claim
was
untrue
according
to
tabloid
reports
that
are
widely
cited
jackson
had
disseminated
the
fabricated
story
himself[69][70]
when
jackson
bought
a
chimpanzee
called
bubbles
from
a
laboratory
he
was
reported
to
be
increasingly
detached
from
reality[71]
it
was
reported
that
jackson
had
offered
to
buy
the
bones
of
joseph
merrick
(the
elephant
man)
and
although
untrue
jackson
did
not
deny
the
story[69][70]
although
initially
he
saw
these
stories
as
opportunities
for
publicity
he
stopped
leaking
untruths
to
the
press
as
they
became
more
sensational
consequently
the
media
began
making
up
their
own
stories[70][72][73]
these
reports
became
embedded
in
the
public
consciousness
inspiring
the
nickname
wacko
jacko
which
jackson
came
to
despise[74]
responding
to
the
gossip
jackson
remarked
to
taraborrelli
why
not
just
tell
people
i'm
an
alien
from
mars?
tell
them
i
eat
live
chickens
and
do
a
voodoo
dance
at
midnight
they'll
believe
anything
you
say
because
you're
a
reporter
but
if
i
michael
jackson
were
to
say
i'm
an
alien
from
mars
and
i
eat
live
chickens
and
do
a
voodoo
dance
at
midnight
people
would
say
oh
man
that
michael
jackson
is
nuts
he's
cracked
up
you
can't
believe
a
single
word
that
comes
out
of
his
mouth[75]

jackson
disassociated
himself
from
the
jehovah's
witnesses
in
response
to
their
disapproval
of
the
thriller
video[78]
with
the
industry
expecting
another
major
hit
jackson's
first
album
in
five
years
bad

was
highly
anticipated[79]
it
did
not
top
thriller
as
a
commercial
or
artistic
triumph
but
bad
was
still
a
substantial
success
in
its
own
right
the
bad
album
spawned
seven
hit
singles
in

the

still
proved

goal
was

years
and
it
would
be
the
last
album
of
new
material
he
released
while
still
alive
the
release
of
the
album
was
preceded
by
a
dispute
between
jackson
and
his
record
label
sony
music
entertainment
jackson
had
expected
the
licenses
to
the
masters
of
his
albums
to
revert
to
him
sometime
in
the
early
2000s
once
he
had
the
licenses
he
would
be
able
to
promote
the
material
however
he
pleased
and
keep
all
the
profits
however
due
to
various
clauses
in
the
contract
the
revert
date
turned
out
to
be
many
years
away
jackson
discovered
that
the
attorney
who
represented
him
in
the
deal
was
also
representing
sony[162]
jackson
was
also
concerned
about
the
fact
that
for
a
number
of
years
sony
had
been
pressuring
him
to
sell
his
share
in
their
music
catalog
venture
jackson
feared
that
sony
might
have
a
conflict
of
interest
since
if
jackson's
career
failed
he
would
have
to
sell
his
share
of
the
catalog
at
a
low
price[166]
jackson
sought
an
early
exit
from
his
contract[162]
just
before
the
release
of
invincible
jackson
informed
the
head
of
sony
music
entertainment
tommy
mottola
that
he
was
leaving
sony[162]
as
a
result
all
singles
releases
video
shootings
and
promotions
concerning
the
invincible
album
were
suspended
in
september
2001
two
30th
anniversary
concerts
were
held
at
madison
square
garden
to
mark
the
singer's
30th
year
as
a
solo
artist
jackson
appeared
onstage
alongside
his
brothers
for
the
first
time
since
1984
the
show
also
featured
performances
by
m&yacutea
usher
whitney
houston
'n
sync
destiny's
child
monica
luther
vandross
and
slash
among
other
artists[167]
the
second
of
the
two
shows
took
place
the
night
before
the
september
11
2001
terrorist
attacks[168]
after
9/11
jackson
helped
organize
the
united
we
stand
what
more
can
i
give
benefit
concert
at
rfk
stadium
in
washington
dc
the
concert
took
place
on
october
21
2001
and
included
performances
from
dozens
of
major
artists
including
jackson
who
performed
his
song
what
more
can
i
give
as
the
finale[166]
jackson's
solo
performances
were
omitted
from
the
televised
version
of
the
benefit
concert
although
he
could
still
be
seen
singing
background
vocals
this
omission
happened
because
of
contractual
issues
related
to
the
earlier
30th
anniversary
concerts
those
concerts
were
boiled
down
into
a
twohour
tv
special
titled
michael
jackson
30th
anniversary
celebration
which
debuted
in
november
2001
in
spite
of
the
events
preceding
its
release
invincible
came
out
in
october
2001
to
much
anticipation
invincible
proved
to
be
a
hit
debuting
atop
the
charts
in
13
countries
and
going
on
to
sell
approximately
13&nbspmillion
copies
worldwide
it
received
doubleplatinum
certification
in
the
us[112][115][169]
however
the
sales
for
invincible
were
lower
than
those
of
his
previous
releases
due
in
part
to
a
lack
of
promotion
no
supporting
world
tour
and
the
label
dispute
the
album
also
came
out
at
a
bad
time
for
the
music
industry
in
general[166]
the
album
cost
$30
million
to
record
not
including
promotional
expenditures[170]
invincible
spawned
three
singles
you
rock
my
world
cry
and
butterflies
the
latter
without
a
music
video
jackson
alleged
in
july
2002
that
mottola
was
a
devil
and
a
racist
who
did
not
support
his
africanamerican
artists
using
them
merely
for
his
own
personal
gain[166]
he
charged
that
mottola
had
called
his
colleague
irv
gotti
a
fat
nigger[171]
sony
refused
to
renew
jackson's
contract
and
claimed
that
a
$25
million
promotional
campaign
had
failed
because
jackson
refused
to
tour
in
the
united
states[170]
in
2002
michael
jackson
won
his
22nd
american

third
child
prince
michael
jackson&nbspii
(nicknamed
blanket)
was
born[173]
the
mother's
identity
is
unknown
but
jackson
has
said
the
child
was
the
result
of
artificial
insemination
from
a
surrogate
mother
and
his
own
sperm[159]
on
november
20
of
that
year
jackson
brought
his
newborn
son
onto
the
balcony
of
his
room
at
the
hotel
adlon
in
berlin
as
fans
stood
below
holding
him
in
his

with
a
cloth
loosely
draped
over
the
baby's
face
the
baby
was
briefly
extended
over
a
railing
four
stories
above
ground
level
causing
widespread
criticism
in
the

jackson
later
apologized
for
the
incident
calling
it
a
terrible
mistake[174]

controversial

one

jackson's
music
took
root
in

pop
and

he
had
been
influenced
by
the
work
of
contemporary
musicians
such
as
little
richard
james
brown
jackie

diana
ross
fred

sammy

according
to
david

who
met
and
befriended
jackson
while
choreographing

1971
diana
ross
tv
special
diana!
(which
was
also
jackson's
first
solo
debut
outside
of
the
jackson
5)
jackson
watched
west
side
story
almost
every
week
and
it
was
his
favorite
film[281][282][283]
while
little
richard
had
a
substantial
influence
on
jackson[284][285]
james
brown
was
jackson's
greatest
inspiration
in
reference
to
brown
jackson
declared
ever
since
i
was
a
small
child
no
more
than
like
six
years
old
my
mother
would
wake
me
no
matter
what
time
it
was
if
i
was
sleeping
no
matter
what
i
was
doing
to
watch
the
television
to
see
the
master
at
work
and
when
i
saw
him
move
i
was
mesmerized
i
had
never
seen
a
performer
perform
like
james
brown
and
right
then
and
there
i
knew
that
was
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
do
for
the
rest
of
my
life
because
of
james
brown[286]
the
young
michael
jackson
owed
his
vocal
technique
in
large
part
to
diana
ross
not
only
a
mother
figure
to
him
she
was
often
observed
in
rehearsal
as
an
accomplished
performer
he
later
expressed
i
got
to
know
her
well
she
taught
me
so
much
i
used
to
just
sit
in
the
corner
and
watch
the
way
she
moved
she
was
art
in
motion
i
studied
the
way
she
moved
the
way
she
sang&nbsp–
just
the
way
she
was
he
told
her
i
want
to
be
just
like
you
diana
she
said
you
just
be
yourself[287]
but
jackson
owed
part
of
his
enduring
style—especially
his
use
of
the
oooh
interjection—to
ross
from
a
young
age
jackson
often
punctuated
his
verses
with
a
sudden
exclamation
of
oooh
diana
ross
had
used
this
effect
on
many
of
the
songs
recorded
with
the
supremes[288]
musical
themes
and
genres
unlike
many
artists
jackson
did
not
write
his
songs
on
paper
instead
he
would
dictate
into
a
sound
recorder
and
when
recording
he
would
sing
the
lyrics
from
memory[289]
in
most
of
his
songs
such
as
billie
jean
who
is
it
and
tabloid
junkie
he
would
beatbox
and
imitate
the
instruments
using
his
voice
instead
of
playing
the
actual
instruments
along
with
other
sounds
jackson
noted
that
it
is
easier
to
sing
a
drum
line
or
sing
a
bass
instead
of
playing
a
drum
line
or
a
bass
with
an
instrument
several
critics
have
said
that
jackson's
distinct
voice
was
able
to
replace
any
instrument
convincingly
steve
huey
of
allmusic
said
that
throughout
his
solo
career
jackson's
versatility
allowed
him
to
experiment
with
various
themes
and
genres[290]
as
a
musician
he
ranged
from
motown's
dance
fare
and
ballads
to
techno
and
houseedged
new
jack
swing
to
work
that
incorporates
both
funk
rhythms
and
hard
rock
guitar[99][291][292]
jackson
in
1988
performing
live
at
his
recordbreaking
bad
world
tour
according
to
huey
thriller
refined
the
strengths
of
off
the
wall
the
dance
and
rock
tracks
were
more
aggressive
while
the
pop
tunes
and
ballads
were
softer
and
more
soulful[290]
notable
tracks
included
the
ballads
the

with

christopher
connelly
of
rolling
stone
commented
that
jackson
developed
his
long
association
with
the
subliminal
theme
of
paranoia
and
darker
imagery[294]
allmusic's
stephen
thomas
erlewine
noted
this
is
evident
on
the
songs
billie
jean
and
wanna
be
startin'
somethin'[292]
in
billie
jean
jackson
sings
about
an
obsessive
fan
who
alleges
he
has
fathered
a
child
of
hers[290]
in
wanna
be
startin'
somethin'
he
argues
against
gossip
and
the
media[294]
beat
it
decried
gang
violence
in
an
homage
to
west
side
story
and
was
jackson's
first
successful
rock
crossover
piece
according
to
huey[99][290]
he
also
observed
that
the
title
track
thriller
began
jackson's
interest
with
the
theme
of
the
supernatural
a
topic
he

rolling

was
of
the
opinion
that
jackson
was
then
singing
in
a

that
was
tinged
by
sadness[294]
a
distinctive
deliberate
mispronunciation

also
a

he
gulps

his

quivers
with

drops
to
a

whisper
hissing
through

he

a
moment

significance
saying
michael

the
unprecedented
global

concert

earnings
and
wealth
it's
estimated
that
michael

earned
about
$750
million
in
his
lifetime[371]
in
the
last
several
decades
of
his
life
sales
of
his
recordings
through
sony's
music
unit
have
earned
him
an
estimated
$300
million
in
royalties
he
may
have
also
earned
an
additional
$400
million
from
concerts
music

catalog)
endorsements
merchandising
and
music

estimating
how
much
of
these
earnings
jackson

able
to
personally
pocket
