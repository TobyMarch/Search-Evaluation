recorded
by

two

michel's
marriage
and
performed
christine

then
after
she
grew
up
singing
with
her
siblings
in
her
parents'
small
piano
bar
called
le
vieux
baril
from
an
early
age
dion
had
dreamed
of
being
a
performer[31]
in
a
1994
interview
with
people
magazine
she
recalled
i
missed
my
family
and
my
home
but
i
don't
regret
having
lost
my
adolescence
i
had
one
dream
i
wanted
to
be
a
singer[32]
at
age
12
dion
collaborated
with
her
mother
and
her
brother
jacques
to
compose
her
first
song
ce
n'&eacutetait
qu'un
r&ecircve
(it
was
only
a
dream)[27]
her
brother
michel
dondalinger
dion
sent
the
recording
to
music
manager
ren&eacute
ang&eacutelil
whose
name
he
discovered
on
the
back
of
a
ginette
reno
album[5]
ang&eacutelil
was
moved
to
tears
by
dion's
voice
and
decided
to
make
her
a
star[27]
in
1981
he
mortgaged
his
home
to
fund
her
first
record
la
voix
du
bon
dieu
(the
voice
of
the
good
god)
which
later
became
a
local
numberone
hit
and
made
dion
an
instant
star
in
quebec
her
popularity
spread
to
other
parts
of
the
world
when
she
competed
in
the
1982
yamaha
world
popular
song
festival
in
tokyo
japan
and
won
the
musician's
award
for
top
performer
as
well
as
the
gold
medal
for
best
song
with
tellement
j'ai
d'amour
pour
toi
(i
have
so
much
love
for
you)[5]
by
1983
in
addition
to
becoming
the
first
canadian
artist
to
receive
a
gold
record
in
france
for
the
single
d'amour
ou
d'amiti&eacute
(of
love
or
of
friendship)
dion
had
also
won
several
f&eacutelix
awards
including
best
female
performer
and
discovery
of
the
year[5][33]
further
success
in
europe
asia
and
australia
came
when
dion
represented
switzerland
in
the
1988
eurovision
song
contest
with
the
song
ne
partez
pas
sans
moi
(don't
go
without
me)
and
won
the
contest
by
a
close
margin
in
dublin
ireland[34]
however
american
success
was
yet
to
come
partly
because
she
was
exclusively
a
francophone
artist[35]
at
eighteen
after
seeing
a
michael
jackson
performance
dion
told
ang&eacutelil
that
she
wanted
to
be
a
star
like
jackson[36]
though
confident
in
her
talent
ang&eacutelil
realized
that
her
image
needed
to
be
changed
in
order
for
her
to
be
marketed
worldwide[27]
dion
receded
from
the
spotlight
for
a
number
of
months
during
which
she
underwent
dental
surgery
to
improve
her
appearance
and
was
sent
to
the
&eacutecole
berlitz
in
1989
to
polish
her
english[6]
in
1989
during
a
concert
on
incognito
tour
dion
injured
her
voice
she
consulted
the
otorhinolaryngologist
william
gould[37][38]
he
gave
her
an
ultimatum
have
surgery
on
her
vocal
cords
or
not
utilize
them
at
all
for
three
weeks[37]
dion
chose
the
latter
and
underwent
a
vocal
formation
with
william
riley[37][38]
because
according
to
gould
and
riley
she
doesn't
know
singing
she
made
a
bad
use
of
her
vocal
cords[37][38]

with

she
incorporated
the

of
many
established
musicians

was
largely
influenced

that
she
never
attempted

bring
off
styles
that
are

her[40]

which
like

had
a
strong
rock
influence
combined
with
elements
of

classical
music
owing

c&eacuteline
dion
and
media
appearances
had
propelled
dion
to
superstardom
in

america
she
had
achieved
one
of
her
main
objectives
wedging
her
way
into
the
anglophone
market
and
achieving
fame[35]
however
while
she
was
experiencing
rising
success
in

her
french
fans
in

later
regain
her
fan
base

openly
refused

she
was—and
would
always
be—a

a
more
adult
contemporary
feel[69]
however
the
theme
of

remained
in

of

led
to
some
critics
dismissing
her

as
banal[99]
other

jose

praised
her

versatile

sentimental[132]
while

reborn[133]

4
types
(1

4

released
in
october
2003
fared
better
than
her
first
two
releases
and
showed
dion
trying
to
distance
herself
from
the
diva
image
she
recruited
jeanjacques
goldman
gildas
arzel
eric
benzi
and
jacques
veneruso
with
whom
she
had
previously
worked
on
two
of
her
bestselling
french
albums
s'il
suffisait
d'aimer
and
d'eux
labeled
the
album
of
pleasure
by
dion
herself
the
album
cover
showed
dion
in
a
simple
and
relaxed
manner
contrary
to
the
choreographed
poses
usually
found
on
her
album
covers
the
album
achieved
widespread
commercial
success
in
france
canada
and
belgium
where
it
reached
number

in
france
the
album
debuted
at
number
one
and
was
later
certified
2x
platinum
after
selling
over
700000
copies
critic
stephen
erlewine
of
allmusic
wrote
that
dion's
vocals
are
back
at
top
of
their
game
and
that
she
was
getting
back
to
pop
basics
and
performing
at
a
level
unheard
in
a
while[135]
though
her
albums
were
commercially
successful
they
did
not
achieve
the
sales
or
the
reception
of
her
previous
works
albums
like
the
collector's
series
volume
one
(2000)
and
one
heart
(2003)
did
not
perform
as
well
critically[125][125]
her
songs
received
less
airplay
as
radio
became
less
embracing
of
balladeers
like
dion
carey
and
houston
and
was
focused
on
more
uptempo
urban/hiphop
songs[136]
however
by
2004
dion
had
accumulated
sales
of
more
than
175
million
albums
worldwide
and
received
the
chopard
diamond
award
from
the
world
music
awards
for
her
achievements[137]
according
to
the
official
world
music
awards
website
the
award
is
rare
it
is
not
presented
every
year
and
an
artist
can
only
be
presented
with
the
award
for
selling
over
100
million
albums
during
their
career[138]
2003–07
a
new
day
in
early
2002
dion
had
announced
a
threeyear
600show
contract
to
appear
five
nights
a
week
in
an
entertainment
extravaganza
a
new
day
at
the
colosseum
at
caesars
palace
las
vegas[12]
this
move
was
seen
as
one
of
the
smartest
business
decisions
in
years
by
any
major
recording
artist[139]
she
conceived
the
idea
for
the
show
after
seeing
o
by
franco
dragone
early
in
her
break
from
recording
and
began
on
march
25
2003
in
a

designed
for
her
show[12]
many

attended
opening
night
including
dick
clark
alan
thicke
kathy
griffin
and
justin
timberlake
who
hosted
the
television
special[140]
the
show
put
together
by
dragone
was
a
combination
of
dance
music
and
visual
effects
it
included
dion
performing
her
biggest
hits
against
an
array
of
dancers
and
special
effects
reviewer
mike
weatherford
felt
that
at
first
dion
was
not
as
relaxed
as
she
should
be
and
at
times
it
was
hard
to
find
the
singer
among
the
excessive
stage
ornamentations
and
dancers
however
he
noted
that
the
show
had
become
more
enjoyable
due
to
dion's
improved
stagepresence
and
simpler
costumes[78]
the
show
was
also
wellreceived
by
audiences
despite
the
complaints
of
expensive
tickets
the
show
routinely
sold
out
until
its
end
in
late
2007[141]
ticket
prices
averaged
$13533[142]
the
show
was
choreographed
by
mia
michaels
who
is
a
world
renowned
choreographer
according
to
pollstar
dion
sold
322000
tickets
and
grossed

a

also

she
grew
up
listening
to
artists
such
as
janis

the
doobie
brothers
and
creedence
clearwater
revival
but
never
got
the

she
also
was
inspired
by
fellow
vocalist
whitney
houston
whom
dion
has
often
been
compared
to[192]
her
music
has
been
influenced
by
numerous
genres
including
pop

gospel
rb
and
soul
and
her
lyrics
focus
on
themes
of
poverty

hunger

musical
style
dion
has
faced
considerable
criticism
from
critics
who
state
that
her
music
often
retreats
behind
pop
and
soul
conventions
and
is
marked
by
excessive
sentimentality[6][99]
according
to
keith
harris
of
rolling
stone
magazine
[dion's]
sentimentality
is
bombastic
and
defiant
rather
than
demure
and
retiring[she]
stands
at
the
end
of
the
chain
of
drastic
devolution
that
goes
arethawhitneymariah
far
from
being
an
aberration
dion
actually
stands
as
a
symbol
of
a
certain
kind
of
pop
sensibility—bigger
is
better
too
much
is
never
enough
and
the
riper
the
emotion
the
more
true[197]
dion's
francophone
releases
by
contrast
tend
to
be
deeper
and
more
varied
than
her
english
releases
and
consequently
have
achieved
more
credibility[43][198]
critics
have
stated
that
dion's
involvement
in
the
production
aspect
of
her
music
is
fundamentally
lacking
which
results
in
her
work
being
overproduced[198]
and
impersonal[43]
however
coming
from
a
family
in
which
all
of
her
siblings
were
musicians
she
learned
to
play
instruments
like
piano
and
guitar
and
practiced
with
a
fender
stratocaster
during
the
recording
sessions
of
her
album
falling
into
you
[199]
also
she
helped
to
compose
many
of
her
earlier
french
songs
and
had
always
tried
to
involve
herself
with
the
production
and
recording
of
her
albums
on
her
first
english
album
which
she
recorded
before
she
had
a
firm
command
of
the
english
language
she
expressed
disapproval
of
the
record
which
could
have
been
avoided
if
she
had
assumed
more
creative
input[43]
by
the
time
she
released
her
second
english
album
celine
dion
she
had
assumed
more
control
of
the
production
and
recording
process
hoping
to
dispel
earlier
criticisms
she
stated
on
the
second
album
i
said
'well
i
have
the
choice
to
be
afraid
one
more
time
and
not
be
100%
happy
or
not
be
afraid
and
be
part
of
this
album'
this
is
my
album[43]
she
would
continue
to
involve
herself
in
the
production
of
subsequent
releases
helping
to
write
a
few
of
her
songs
on
let's
talk
about
love
(1997)
and
these
are
special
times
(1998)[2]
dion
is
often
the
subject
of
media
ridicule[200]
and
parody
and
is
frequently
impersonated
on
shows
like
madtv
saturday
night
live
south
park
royal
canadian
air
farce
and
this
hour
has
22
minutes
for
her
strong
accent
and
onstage
movements
however
dion
has
stated
that
she
is
unaffected
by
the
comments
and
is
flattered
that
people
take
the
time
to
impersonate
her[103]
she
even
invited
ana
gasteyer
who
parodied
her
on
snl
to
appear
on
stage
during
one
of
her
performances
while
she
is
rarely
politically
outspoken
in
2005
following
the
hurricane
katrina
disaster
dion
appeared
on
larry
king
live
and
tearfully
criticized
the
us
government's
slow
response
in
aiding
the
victims
of
the
hurricane
there's
people
still
there
waiting
to
be
rescued
to
me
that
is
not
acceptablehow
can
it
be
so
easy
to
send
planes
in
another
country
to
kill
everybody
in
a
second
and
destroy
lives
we
need
to
serve
our
country[201]
after
her
interview
she
stated
when
i
do
interviews
with
larry
king
or
the
big
tv
shows
like
that
they
put
you
on
the
spot
which
is
very
difficult
i
do
have
an
opinion
but
i'm
a
singer
i'm
not
a
politician[202]
voice
and
timbre
dion
is
often
regarded
as
one
of
pop
music's
most
influential
voices[6][43][203]
she
has
been
described
as
a
reigning
queen
of
pop
for
her
influence
over
the
record
industry
during
the
1990s
alongside
other
female
entertainers
including
whitney
houston
and
mariah
carey[204]
in
a
countdown
of
the
22
greatest
voices
in
music
by
blender
magazine
and
mtv
she
placed
ninth
(sixth
for
a
female)
and
she
was
also
placed
fourth
in
cove
magazine's
list
of
the
100
outstanding
pop
vocalists[17][205][206]
dion
is
often
compared
to
mariah
carey
for
her
vocal
style
and
to
her
idol
barbra
streisand
for
her
voice[207]
according
to
various
sources
dion
possesses
a
fiveoctave
vocal
range[208][209][210][211]
dion
states
she
is
a
mezzosoprano[212]
however
attempts
to
adopt
classical
voice
types
to
other
forms
of
singing
has
been
met
with
controversy[213]
without
making
a
classification
maestro
kent
nagano
remarked
all
you
just
sang
was
soprano
after
dion
auditioned
with
two
solos
of
carmen
wanting
to
know
if
she
could
sing
opera[212]
her
timbre
has
been
described
as
thin
slightly
nasal
nearly
vibratoless[214]
with
a
raspy
lower
register
and
bell
glasslike
high
notes[215]
dion
is
often
praised
for
her
technical
virtuosity[216]
stephen
holden
of
the
new
york
times
writes
ms
dion
[]
is
a
belter
with
a
high
thin
slightly
nasal
nearly
vibratoless
soprano
and
a
goodsized
arsenal
of
technical
skills
she
can
deliver
tricky
melismas
produce
expressive
vocal
catches
and
sustain
long
notes
without
the
tiniest
wavering
of
pitch
and
as
her
duets
[]
have
shown
she
is
a
reliable
harmony
voice[214]
in
an
interview
with
lib&eacuteration
jeanjacques
goldman
states
that
she
has
no
problem
of
accuracy
or
tempo[217]
according
to
kent
nagano
maestro
of
the
munich
symphony
orchestra
dion
is
a
musician
who
has
a
good
ear
a
refinement
and
a
degree
of
perfection
that
is
enviable[212]

glides
effortlessly
from
deep
whispers
to
deadon
high
notes
a
sweet
siren

grace[35]
in
her
french

dion
adorns
