discovers
anakin
he
insists
that
the
boy
be
trained
as
a
jedi
despite
the
protests
of
the
council
lucas
originally
envisioned
an
american
actor
in
the
role
but
cast
neeson
who
is
irish
because
he
considered
neeson
to
have
great
skills
and
presence
describing
him
as
a
master
actor
who
the
other
actors
will
look
up
to
who
has
got
the
qualities
of
strength
that
the
character
demands[3]

padawan
apprentice
he
holds
quigon
in
high
regard
but
questions
his

at
times
mcgregor
prepared
for
the
role
by
watching

portrayed
the
elderly
obiwan
in
both
the
original
star

trilogy
and

early
work[3]
natalie

as
queen
padm&eacute
amidala
the
young
queen
of
naboo
at
14
years
of
age
amidala
hopes
to
protect
her
planet
from
a
blockade
brought
on
by
the
trade
federation
over
200
actresses
were
auditioned
for
the
role[4]
with
production
notes
stating
that
the
role
required
a
young
woman
who
could
be
believable
as
the
ruler
of
that
planet
but
at
the
same
time
be
vulnerable
and
open
portman
was
chosen
especially
for
her
performances
in
the
professional
(1994)
and
beautiful
girls
(1996)
which
impressed
lucas[3]
he
stated
i
was
looking
for
someone
who
was
young
strong
along
the
lines
of
leia
[and]
natalie
embodied
all
those
traits
and
more[3]
the
actress
was
unfamiliar
with
star
wars
prior
to
being
cast[3]
but
was
enthused
over
being
cast
as
the
queen
of
naboo
a
character
she
expected
to
become
a
role
model
it
was
wonderful
playing
a
young
queen
with
so
much
power
i
think
it
will
be
good
for
young
women
to
see
a
strong
woman
of
action
who
is
also
smart
and
a
leader[5]

16
years
after

production
writing
during
the
process
of
writing
the
original
star
wars
george
lucas
reportedly
realized
that
the
story
he
had
written
was
too
vast
in
scope
to
be
covered
in
one
standalone
film
and
thus
the
original
film
was
meant
to
be
the
introduction
to
a
much
wider
story
arc
that
could
be
covered
by
sequels
if
the
first
film
turned
out
to
be
successful
the
original
movie
eventually
evolved
from
being
the
first
movie
in
the
sequence
to
a
film
actually
belonging
to
the
second
trilogy
in
the
saga[24][25]
by
the
time
of
the
third
draft
lucas
had
negotiated
a
contract
that
gave
him
rights
to
make
two
sequels
he
had
also
by
that
point
developed
a
fairly
elaborate
backstory
to
aid
his
writing
process[26]
while
writing
the
first
sequel
the
empire
strikes
back
lucas
considered
different
directions
in
which
to
take
the
story
he
turned
the
villain
darth
vader
into
the
father
of
hero
luke
skywalker
and
developed
a
backstory
depicting
vader
as
having
once
been
jedi
knight
anakin
skywalker
a
powerful
warrior
who
was
swayed
to
the
dark
side
of
the
force[27]
with
this
new
backstory
in
place
lucas
decided
that
the
series
would
be
a
trilogy
renaming
the
film
from
episode
ii
to
episode
v[28]
by
the
time
of
the
final
film
of
the
trilogy
return
of
the
jedi
vader
became
a
tragic
character
and
was
ultimately
redeemed
however
lucas
stated
that
he
was
burned
out
and
would
take
a
break
from
the
series[29]
after
losing
much
of
his
fortune
in
a
divorce
settlement
in
1987
george
lucas
had
no
desire
to
return
to
star
wars
and
had
unofficially
canceled
his
sequel
trilogy
by
the
time
of
return
of
the
jedi
but
since
lucas
had
developed
most
of
the
backstory
the
idea
of
prequels
continued
to
fascinate
him[30]
in
the
early
1990s
star
wars
saw
a
resurgence
in
popularity
in
the
wake
of
dark
horse's
comic
line
and
timothy
zahn's
trilogy
of
novels
seeing
that
there
was
still
a
large
audience
for
his
idea
of
a
prequel
trilogy
and
with
the
explosion
of
cgi
technology
george
lucas
considered
returning
to
directing[31]
by
1993
it
was
announced
in
variety
among
other
sources
that
he
would
be
making
the
prequels
he
began
outlining
the
story
now
indicating
that
anakin
skywalker
would
be
the
main
protagonist
rather
than
obiwan
kenobi
and
that
the
series
would
be
a
tragic
one
examining
darth
vader's
origins
lucas
also
began
to
change
how
the
prequels
would
exist
relative
to
the
originals
from
a
fillingin
of
history
backstory
existing
parallel
or
tangential
to
the
originals
to
the
beginning
of
one
long
story
that
started
with
anakin's
childhood
and
ended
with
his
death
this
was
the
final
step
towards
turning
the
franchise
into
a
saga[32]
george
lucas
began
writing
the
new
star
wars
trilogy
on
november
1
1994[33]
the
screenplay
for
star
wars
was
adapted
from
lucas'
15page
outline
that
was
written
in
1976
the
early
outline
was
originally
designed
to
help
lucas
track
the
character
backstories
and
what
events
had
taken
place
before
the
original
trilogy[33]
while
the
working
title
for
the
film
was
the
beginning[33]
lucas
later
revealed
the
true
title
to
be
the
phantom
menace
a
reference
to
palpatine
hiding
his
true
identity
as
an
evil
sith
lord
behind
the
facade
of
a
wellintentioned
public
servant[34]

stunt
coordinator
nick
gillard
was
recruited
to
create
a
new
jedi
fighting
style
for
the
prequel
trilogy
gillard
likened
the
lightsaber
battles
to
a
chess
game
with
every
move
being
a
check
because
of
their
shortrange
weapons
gillard
theorized
that
the
jedi
would
have
had
to
develop
a
fighting
style
that
merged
every
swordfighting
style
such
as
kendo
and
other
kenjutsu
styles
with
other
swinging
techniques
such
as
tennis
swings
and
treechopping
while
training
liam
neeson
and
ewan
mcgregor
gillard
would
write
a
sequence
to
be
an
estimated
60
seconds
long
meant
to
be
among
five
to
six
sequences
per
fight[36]
lucas
later
referred
to
jedi
as
being
negotiators
rather
than
highcasualty
soldiers
the
preference
of
handtohand
combat
was
intended
to
give
a
more
spiritual
and
intellectual
role
to
the
jedi[36]
lucas
also
decided
to
make
elaborate
costumes
considering
that
the
society
was
more
sophisticated
than
the
one
depicted
in
the
original
trilogy

up

many
special

in

were
achieved
by
the

previewed

for

to
explain
what
factors
of
the
shots
would
be
practical
and
what
would
be
created
through

knoll
later
recounted
that
on
hearing
the
explanations
of
the
storyboards
he
was
unaware
of
any
way
to
accomplish
what
he
had
seen
the
result
was
to
mix
original
techniques
with
the
newest
digital
techniques
to
make
it
difficult
for
the
viewer
to
guess
which
technique
was
being
used
new
computer
software
was
written
by
knoll
and
his
visual
effects
team
to
create
certain
shots
in
the
film
another
goal
was
to
create
computergenerated
characters
that
could
act
seamlessly
with
liveaction
actors
while
filming
scenes
with
cgi
characters
lucas
would
block
the
characters
using
their
corresponding
voice
actor
onset
the
voice
actors
were
then
removed
and
the
liveaction
actors
would
perform
the
same
scene
alone
a
cgi
character
would
later
be
added
into
the
shot
completing
the
conversation[42]
lucas
also
used
cgi
to
correct
the
physical
presence
of
actors
in
certain
scenes[15]
about
1950
of
the
shots
have
special
effects
with
the
scene
where
toxic
gas
is
released
on
the
jedi
being
the
only
sequence
without
any
digital
alteration[15]
having
confronted
problems
with
the
props
used
to
depict

before
lucas
allowed
two
companies
industrial
light

magic
(ilm)
and
the
production's
british
special

department
to
create
their
own

of

enabling
it
to
run
and
being
mostly
used
in
stage
sets
and
the
british
studio
produced
a
pneumatic
r2
that
was
able
to
shift
from
two
to
three
legs
and
was
mostly
used
in
tunisia
because
that
r2's
motor
drive
system
allowed
it
to
drive
over
sand[43]

research
for

the

scavenged

lifesized

were

decided
to
use
more

more

to
capture
the

one
of
the
most
notable
tracks
is

tried
to
both
reflect

putting
slight

based

reviews
on
both
sites
it
is
the
lowest
rated
film
in
the
star
wars
film
series
many
aspects
of
the
scripting
were
criticized
especially
the
character
of
jar
jar
binks
who
was
regarded
by
many
members
of
the
older
fan
community
as
toyetic
—
purely
a
merchandising
opportunity
rather
than
a
serious
character
in
the
film[83][84][85]
kenneth
turan
of
the
los
angeles
times
described
binks
as
a
major
miscue
a
comicrelief
character
who's
frankly
not
funny
[86]
george
lucas
criticized
the
american
media
for
using
fan
opinions
from
the
internet
as
a
reliable
source
for
their
news
stories[87]
in
2002
with
the
release
of
attack
of
the
clones
ewan
mcgregor
said
that
in
retrospect
the
phantom
menace
slightly
lacked
some
of
the
humor
and
colour
of
the
forthcoming
prequels
he
felt
as
a
result
of
bearing
the
weight
of
setting
up
the
entire
saga
it
seemed
kind
of
flat[88]
one
critic
observed
that
perhaps
the
absolute
creative
freedom
director
george
lucas
enjoyed
while
dreaming
up
the
flick's
'comic'
relief
–
with
no
studio
execs
and
not
many
an
independently
minded
actor
involved
–
is
a
path
to
the
dark
side
[89]
conversely
roger
ebert
of
the
chicago
sun
times
gave
it
three
and
a
half
out
of
four
stars
calling
it
an
astonishing
achievement
in
imaginative
filmmaking
and
stating
that
lucas
tells
a
good
story
ebert
also
commented
that
it
was
perfectly
fine
for
the
characters
being
a
bit
less
compelling
seeing
that
they
were
just
being
introduced
and
hypothetically
entreating
filmmakers
to
give
me
transparent
underwater
cities
and
vast
hollow
senatorial
spheres
any
day[90]
owen
gleiberman
of
entertainment
weekly
gave
the
film
a
b
grade
and
complimented
liam
neeson's
performance
and
the
action
scenes[91]
however
in
another
entertainment
weekly
review
of
the
film
marc
bernardin
gave
the
film
a
c
calling
it
haplessly
plotted
horribly
written
and
juvenile[92]
susan
wloszczyna
of
usa
today
thought
the
movie
did
plenty
right
praising
the
characters
of
darth
maul
and
watto[93]
david
cornelius
of
efilmcriticcom
remarked
that
the
better
moments
of
the
film
don't
merely
balance
out
the
weaker
ones
–
they
topple
them[94]
colin
kennedy
of
empire
said
that
despite
problems
with
pacing
and
writing
there
is
still
much
pleasure
to
be
had
watching
our
fullblown
jedi
guides
in
action
praising
the
visuals
and
liam
neeson's
performance
and
considering
the
duel
between
darth
maul
and
the
jedi
the
saga's
very
best
lightsaber
battle[95]
the
phantom
menace
was
ranked
by
entertainment
weekly
as
one
of
the
25
worst
sequels
ever
made[96]
similarly
comcast
ranked
the
film
among
the
worst
film
sequels
of
all
time[97]
james
berardinelli
would
later
note
the
phantom
menace
was
probably
the
most
overhyped
motion
picture
of
the
last
decade
(if
not
longer)
and
its
reputation
suffered
as
a
result
of
its
inability
to
satisfy
unreasonable
expectations[98]
william
arnold
of
the
seattle
postintelligencer
agreed
that
the
massive
hype
of
the
film
caused
much
of
the
negative
reaction
saying
it
built
expectations
that
can't
possibly
be
matched
and
scuttled
(the)
element
of
storytelling
surprise
however
he
also
felt
that
the
film
was
well
made
and
entertaining
and
believed
it
was
much
better
than
similar
box
office
fare
released
around
that
year
such
as
the
mummy
and
the
matrix[99]
the
introduction
of
midichlorians
(microscopic
organisms
mediate
use
of
the
force)
in
the
film
has
been
controversial
among
fans
those
against
it
have
seen
it
as
a
concept
that
negates
the
spiritual
quality
of
the
force
film
historian
daniel
dinello
notes
anathema
to
star
wars
fanatics
who
thought
they
reduced
the
force
to
a
kind
of
viral
infection
midichlorians
provide
a
biological
interface
the
link
between
physical
bodies
and
spiritual
energy[100]
religion
expert
john
d
caputo
adds
in
the
'gospel
according
to
lucas'
a
world
is
conjured
up
in
which
the
intractable
oppositions
that
have
tormented
religious
thinkers
for
centuries
are
reconciled

the
gifts
that
the
jedi
masters
enjoy
have
a
perfectly
plausible
scientific
basis
even
if
its
ways
are
mysterious
their
bodily
cells
have
a
heavier
than
usual
concentration
of
'midichlorians'[101]
after
the
release
of
the
film
there
was
controversy
over
whether
several
alien
characters
reflected
racial
stereotypes
notably
the
oafish
slowwitted
jar
jar
binks
had
long
droopy
ears
reminiscent
of
dreadlocks
and
spoke
with
what
many
perceived
as
a
caribbean
patois
(particularly
jamaican
creole)[102]
the
greedy
and
corrupt
neimoidians
of
the
trade
federation
spoke
with
east
asian
accents
and
the
unprincipled
desert
trader
watto
has
been
interpreted
as
a
faginesque
jewish
stereotype
lucas
has
categorically
denied
all
of
these
implications[83]
however
animator
rob
coleman
admitted
that
he
viewed
footage
of
alec
guinness
as
fagin
in
oliver
twist
to
inspire
his
animators
in
creating
watto[103]
jar
jar
binks
was
described
by
one
critic
as
servile
and
cowardlya
black
minstrelish
stereotype
on

with
stepin

michael
eric
dyson
professor
of
africanamerican
studies
at
georgetown
university
observed
that
the
entire
gungan
people
seem
oddly
suggestive
of
a
primitive
african
tribe
the
leader
of
jar
jar's
tribe
is
a
fat
bumbling
buffoon
with
a
rumbling
voice
and
he
seems
to
be
a
caricature
of

from

the

typically
mix
several
selected

[122]
the

translations
of

(zurvan)
the
prime

these
elements
derive
primarily
from
eastern
and
iranian
religions
and
myths[122]
there
are
many
references
to
christian
mythology
in
the
film
such
as
the
appearance
of
darth
maul
whose
design
draws
heavily
from
traditional
depictions
of
the
christian
devil
complete
with
red
skin
and
horns[122]
the

fulfilling
his
destiny
as
the
chosen
one
–
the
individual
prophesied
to
bring
balance
to
the
force
the
inspiration
behind
the
story
of
the
virgin
birth
parallels
a
concept
developed
by
joseph
campbell
and
his
work
on
the
hero
with
a
thousand
faces
the
same
work
that
heavily
influenced
lucas
in
his
writing
of
the
original
star
wars
trilogy's
outline[122]
japanese
film
such
as
akira
kurosawa's
the
hidden
fortress
was
a
source
of
inspiration
for
the
original
star
wars
film
and
scholars
point
out
that
the
phantom
menace
was
likewise
influenced
by
japanese
culture
film
historians
geoff
king
and
tanya
krzywinska
assert
the
costume
and
makeup
designs

favour
a
mixture
of
the
gothic
and
the
oriental
over
anything
very
futuristic
the
gothic
is
most
strongly
apparent
in
darth
maul's
demonic
horns
and
the
red
and
black
makeup
mask
that
borrows
from
the
facial
designs
found
in
depictions
of
japanese
demons
king
and
krzywinska
note
that
quigon's
pony
tail
and
obiwan's
position
of
apprentice
further
encourage
a
reading
in
terms
of
the
samurai
tradition
finally
amidala
in
keeping
with
her
status
and
character
has
a
number
of
highly
formal
outfits

to
go
with
hair
sculpted
into
a
curve
that
frames
makeup
of
a
japanese
cast[123]
the
design
of
queen
amidala's
personal
spaceship
is
based
on
the
actual
us
strategic
reconnaissance
airplane
lockheed
sr71
blackbird[citation
