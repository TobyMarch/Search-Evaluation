umberto
eco
is
internationally
renowned
as
an
author
a
philosopher
a
literary
critic
and
a
historian
he
is
also
a
professor
of
semiotics
at
the
university
of
bologna
and
lives
in
milan
the
name
of
the
rose
his
debut
novel
was
first
published
in
italy
in
1980
and
became
a
bestseller
throughout
the
world
it
was
also
adapted
for
the
big
screen
in
1986
a
version
that
starred
sean
connery
and
christian
slater
the
name
of
the
rose
is
set
in
the
fourteenth
century
and
is
told
by
adso
of
melk

an
aged
benedictine
abbot
looking
back
to
a
journey
he
took
as
a
novice
adso's
father
was
a
german
nobleman
loyal
to
louis
the
bavarian
and
arranged
for
the
young
adso
to
travel
with
him
to
italy

there
he
hoped
to
see
louis
crowned
holy
roman
emperor
however
with
his
father's
time
subsequently
taken
up
with
the
siege
of
pisa
adso
was
placed
in
the
care
of
william
of
baskerville

not
only
a
shrewd
learned
and
wise
franciscan
but
also
a
former
inquisitor
together
the
pair
travel
to
a
benedictine
abbey
in
the
northern
italian
mountains
the
arena
in
which
william
and
adso
operate
is
at
least
as
political
as
it
is
religious
there
are
great
differences
of
opinion
between
the
orders
on
a
number
of
topics

the
most
relevant
to
the
story
involves
a
difference
in
opinion
about
poverty
between
the
franciscan
order
and
the
pope
since
the
pope
and
the
emperor
don't
see
eyetoeye
either
louis
has
obviously
sided
with
the
franciscans
the
order's
head
michael
of
cesena
has
been
summoned
several
times
to
avignon

where
the
papal
court
was
held
at
the
time

officially
to
deal
conclusively
with
the
matter
however
since
many
suspect
this
would
actually
involve
michael
being
charged
with
heresy
the
emperor
feels
it
best
if
michael
travels
as
part
of
an
official
imperial
delegation
as
the
whole
matter
is
proving
increasingly
difficult
to
deal
with
a
preliminary
meeting
has
been
arranged
to
lay
out
the
opposing
points
of
view
william
has
been
appointed
the
emperor's
representative
and
the
meeting
is
taking
place
at
the
abbey
to
which
he
and
adso
are
travelling
as
it
happens
the
pair
are
given
much
more
to
think
about
than
just
the
meeting
not
long
before
william
and
adso
arrived
one
of
the
abbey's
most
skilled
illuminators

adelmo
of
otranto

had
been
found
dead
at
the
foot
of
some
cliffs
beneath
the
abbey
the
abbot
suspects
the
young
monk
was
murdered
and
asks
william
to
investigate
things
are
not
made
entirely
easy
for
the
pair

although
adelmo
may
have
been
pushed
to
his
death
from
the
upper
floor
of
the
library
they
are
forbidden
from
entering
that
area
nevertheless
with
the
meeting
imminent
they
know
it's
vital
to
have
everything
cleared
up
as
soon
as
possible

preferably
with
out
any
more
deaths
this
is
a
hugely
enjoyable
book

the
only
real
flaw
is
that
it's
occasionally
a
little
overdescriptive
however
it
makes
a
nice
change
to
read
a
murdermystery
than
relies
solely
on
the
skills
of
the
investigator

particularly
one
as
likeable
as
william

without
any
help
from
forensics
fingerprinting
or
dna
sampling
the
'backstory'
relating
to
the
meeting
added
a
nice
political
spin
to
things
it
also
added
a
certain
amount
of
panic
for
some
of
the
characters
as
the
pope's
representative
is
also
a
practising
inquisitor

very
highly

umberto
eco
doesn't
just
tell
a
story
this
much
is
obvious
from
all
of
his
novels
not
the
least
of
which
is
the
name
of
the
rose
he
has
crafted
a
wonderfully
intriguing
medieval
murder
mystery
(at
heart)
and
fleshed
it
out
with
splendid
characters
(especially
the
protagonist
who
must
rely
on
good
ol'fashioned
detective
work
to
crack
the
case)
a
wellrealized
backdrop
of
history
and
location
and
incorporated
cyptology
and
theology
for
good
measure
smart
without
being
overwhelming
taut
without
being
heavyhanded
historical
without
being
boring
the
name
of
the
rose
is
not
just
one
of
eco's
best
books
but
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
reads
i've

may
13

by
matthew
krichman
formatpaperback
though
at
times
painfully
tedious
in
its
detail
of
14th
century
catholic
theology
and
annoyingly
esoteric
in
its
numerous
passages
in
latin
i
feel
i
must
give
this
book
a
positive
recommendation
its
grand
scope
of
chronicling
such
an
obscure
period
its
depth
of
research
and
its
feeling
of
authenticity
give
this
book
the
right
to
be
considered
an
epic
of
modern
fiction
as
far
as
mysteries
go
this
one
certainly
is
not
the
most
intriguing
it
drags
at
times
and
the
final
revelations
are
neither
startling
nor
intricate
in
their
conception
but
as
a
period
piece
this
is
a
500pound
gorilla
it's
amazing
to
think
of
the
amount
of
scholarly
research
that
went
into
the
making
of
this
novel
how
many
hours
did
eco
have
to
spend
studying
the
writings
of
aristotle
aquinas
and
who
knows
how
many
franciscan
and
benedictine
theologians?
i
have
to
admit
i
came
close
to
putting
this
book
down
after
100
pages
i'm
glad
i
didn't
though
it
was
a
struggle
the
whole
way
through
there
were
a
few
too
many
characters
and
at
times
i
couldn't
keep
track
of
all
the
different
monks
but
fortunately
they
start
to
get
killed
off
pretty
quickly
so
there
are
fewer
to
remember
the
underlying
theme
is
an
important
one
to
me
the
book
explores
the
medieval
notion
that
religious
faith
and
intellectual
pursuits
should
be
mutually
exclusive
imagine
living
your
life
as
a
monk
working
in
a
library
surrounded
by
thousands
of
scholarly
works
and
spending
your
days
copying
texts
that
you
don't
understand
the
preservation
of
knowledge
is
a
noble
goal
but
so
is
the
advancement
of
our
understanding
of
the
universe

mystery
meets
history
if
you're
into
medieval
times
murder
and
mystery
then
look
no
further

book
is
hard
to
put
down
i
recommend
it
for
a
nice
cool
dark
and

not
a
status
symbol
i
am
confused
by
those
who
wrote
that
people
only
say
they
read
this
book
because
they
want
to
sound
smart

nearly
as
complicated
as
aristotle
himself!
this
book
is
not
an
easy
read
that
can
be
read
in
one
weekend
or
a
whole
week
for
that
matter
this
novel
compares
to
conrads
heart
of
darkness
a
novel
of
equal
density

this

for
an

devoured
it

for
it
is
a
tale
of
books
not
of
everyday
worries
the
name
of
the
rose
has
gained
such
a
reputation
for
its
detail
and
erudition
that
its
finest
attribute
too
often
goes
unmentioned

the

i
hate

i'm
terribly
sorry
