you
lost
me
at
georgecommunist
rapist
murderer
really
guy
even
if
you
don't
like
what
he's
done
with
the
franchise
your
legitimacy
goes
right
out
the
window
when
you
resort
to
tasteless
crap
like
that
as
far
as
episode
1
goes
it
wasn't
a
god
awful
movie
the
visuals
were
still
believable
where
as
episodes
ii
and
iii
made
my
eyes
hurt
from
all
the
cgi
the
only
universal
criticism
i'll
acknowledge
is
jar
jar
he
was
an
obnoxious
character
who
had
more
screen
time
than
necessary﻿

so
you
agree
with
everything
except
for
george
is
a
murderer
rapist
who
just
happens
to
be
a
communist
fair
enough
reviews
are
opinions
some
opinions
may
be
stronger
or
more﻿
exaggerated
than
others
legitimacy
should
be
based
on
the
conviction
and
passion
of
the
reviewer
and
an
honest
opinion
i
gave
you
those
things

i
don't
care
how
you
spell
but
star
wars
ended
in
the
1980's
the
thing
we
got
in
1999
was
based
on﻿
star
wars
but
the
soul
was
missing

well
yes
kershner
made
some
caracter
suggestions
but
they
were
minor
overall
also
isn`t
the
dialogue
a
secondarry
element
but
aside
george
lucas
did
write
half
of
the
dialogue
of
both
sequels
regarding
anakin
being
a
kid
this
was
to
make
him
more
inocent
and
at
the
same
time
more
vanerable
then﻿
luke
it
makes
his
turn
more
tragic

i
do
agree
he
had
some
sort
of
creative
input
with
empire
and
jedi
sure
i
feel
he
does
better
however
with
outside
opinions
as
well
and
i
think
that's
where
the
prequels
suffered
and
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
the
cgi
he
needed
someone
to
brush
up
dialogue(kerschner
in
empire)
make
some
character
suggestions
and
we
could
have
possibly
avoided
first
seeing
anakin
as
a
9yearold
which
to
me
never
really
made
sense
i
think
as
a
teenager
much﻿
like
luke
would
have
been
better

i
will
agree
that
other
people
added
to
it
aswell
but
what
is
important
to
note
is
that
a
new
hope
was
almost
fully
his
but﻿
that
on
empire
and
jedi
other
screenwriters
were
brought
in
to
help
make
it
better
but
this
was
to
work
out
lucases
story
in
detail
with
dialogue
and
other
details
not
to
alter
the
story
the
screenplay
was
a
form
of
giving
the
story
detail
not
changing
it
and
i
agree
lawrence
kasdan
greatly
added
to
both
sequels
but
lucas
still
wrote
half
the
screenplay

i﻿
do
appreciate
a
response
not
filled
with
juvenile
profanity
and
personal
attacks
makes
the

much
