this
might
be
prolonged
because
of
the
studio
fire
but
i
don't
know
if
they
filmed
on
location
for
the
first
three
when
i
went
to
universal
studios
in
california
a
while
ago
they
were
filming
part
3
there
that's
why
i'm
concerned

idk
if
this
is
true
but
i
heard
that
in
jp4

the
dinos
somehow
get
onto
american
soil
and
start
tererizing
a
big
city
like
la
or
