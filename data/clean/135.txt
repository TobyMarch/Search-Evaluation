what
parents

to
know
parents
need
to
know
that
this
complex
original
sciencefiction
fantasy
movie
from
the
director
of
the
dark
knight
has
lots
of
action
and
violence

including
guns
blood
fighting
car
crashes
etc

as
well
as
some
slightly
scary
imagery
but
it's
very
light
on
language
sexy
stuff
and
drinking
so
teen
fans
of
star
leonardo
dicaprio
should
be
able
to
handle
it
it's
not
an
easy
story
to
explain
but
it's
very
easy
to
follow
parents
and
teens
will
likely
want
to
talk
at
length
about
the
story
and
may
even
find
themselves
wanting
to
go
back

a
second
helping
positive
messages1
amid
the
intense
scenes
and
images
the
movie
offers
positive
examples
of
teamwork
and
helping
others
a
subplot
involving
death
and
grieving
also
promotes
acceptance
and
moving
on
a
more
ambiguous
message
is
sent
by
the
main
story
in
which
the
characters
try
to
plant
an
idea
in
someone's
head
against
his
will

but
manage
to
bring
him
a
kind
of
peace

the
process

the
main
character
acts
for
personal

to
earn
the
ability
to
return
home
to
his
kids

and
has
a
job
that's
slightly
on
the
shady
side
but
when
he's
at
work
his
team
shows
excellent
teamwork
as
well
as
selflessness
when
it
comes
to
their
teammates'
well
being
violence4
though
most
of
the
movie's
violence
takes
place
in
dreams
and
is
therefore
not
real
it
includes
guns
and
shooting
gunshot

what's
the
story?
dom
cobb
(leonardo
dicaprio)
is
a
skilled
extractor
able
to
enter
people's
dreams
to
find
information
a
businessman
(ken
watanabe)
hires
cobb
to
plant
an
idea
in
the
mind
of
a
competitor
even
though
this
may
not
be
possible
cobb
assembles
a
team
(which
includes
joseph
gordonlevitt
and
ellen
page)
and
prepares
for
the
complicated
job
which
will
require
creating
three
dreamswithindreams
unfortunately
the
subject
(cillian
murphy)
has
been
trained
for
such
invasions
and
the
job
will
be
far
more
dangerous
than
planned

and
then
there's
the
fact
that
cobb's
dead
wife
(marion
cotillard)
keeps
unexpectedly
turning
up
inside
the
dreams
and
wreaking
havoc
of
her
own
but
if
the
team
fails
they
could
end
up
trapped
in
a
subconscious
limbo
forever
is
it
any
good?
&nbsp
with
only
seven
films
under
his
belt
filmmaker
christopher
nolan
has
proven
himself
a
master
of
time
juggling
he
rarely
presents
a
story
in
chronological
order
he
often
flips
time
or
stacks
time
on
top
of
itself
balancing
several
simultaneous
storylines
precariously
but
with
remarkable
clarity
inception
is
an
intense
complex
story
but
it's
always
coherent
imaginative
and
entertaining
that
said
although
inception
is
a
terrific
film
it
lacks
a
strong
emotional
connection
with
most
of
the
characters

the
movie's
roller
coaster
ride
feel
means
that
there's
little
time
to
stop
and
get
to
know
anyone
likewise
unlike
nolan's
the
dark
knight
it
doesn't
really
represent
any
current
fears
or
desires
save
for
a
vague
fear
of
technology
it's
really
just
a
very
intelligent
slambang
popcorn
movie
and
that's
absolutely

sure

got

some

for

it

&nbsp
it
must
be
hard
to
think
that
christopher
nolan
can
top
the
dark
knight
in
any
way
shape
or
form
oftentimes
in
successful
careers
like
his
the
director
hits
a
high
point
and
immediately
sinks
to
mediocre
projects
(m
night
i'm
talking
about
you!)
however
nolan
tops
his
latest
batman
film
in
every
way
possible
in
the
incredible
picture
inception
this
movie
is
not
only
the
movie
of
the
year
but
also
one
of
the
best
most
enjoyable
movies
i've
ever
seen!
and
i'm
generally
hard
to
please
as
far
as
movies
go
however
inception
does
everything
it's
actionpacked
engaging
entertaining
moving
and
thoughtprovoking
this
movie
is
nothing
short
of
brilliant
and
all
adults
and
teens
should
go
and
see
it
right
away
it's
not
okay
for
kids
however
violence
in
the
movie
is
almost
constant
with
loads
of
explosions
gunfire
and
countless
casualties
however
almost
all
of
these
are
bloodless
and
they
take
place
in
dreams
(thus
rendering
them
harmless
in
real
life)
in
order
to
wake
up
from
a
dream
a
character
needs
to
die
so
the
film
has
countless
harrowing
scenes
that
show
main
characters
commiting
suicide
by
gun
knife
falling
from
great
heights
etc
most
of
this
is
bloodless
but
in
any
case
it
can
get
sort
of
hard
to
watch
a
ton
of
the
movie
is
very
intense
and
nervewracking
and
young
kids
just
flat
out
won't
be
able
to
handle
that
on
the
upside
there
is
no
sex
and
language
is
usually
mild
with
frequent
d**ns
h*lls
and
infrequent
s**ts
what
other
families
should
know
too
violent
language
my
kids
can't
use
