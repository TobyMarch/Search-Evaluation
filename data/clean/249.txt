ouch
hard
to
put
this
one
into
perspective
it
is
a
mix
of
older
and
brand
new
stones
great
tune
that
should
rejuvenate
a
lot
of
stones
fans
(older﻿
and
more
recent)
these
guys
just
have
too
much
talent
and
history
to
be
anything
but
good
sorry
i
meant
great
fantastic
tune
that
will
blow
the
doors
off
anyone's
car
or
home
or
(for
that
sake)

i'm
not
a
religious
stones
fan
i
love
their
stuff
but
i
probably
wouldn't
recognise
any
little
known
b
sides
etc
i
swear
the
first
time﻿
i
heard
this
i
thought
it
was
some
long
lost
60s/70s
track
i'd
never
heard
love
it

maybe!!
however
it
does
sucks
to
think
about
it
but
i
think
when
these
guys
die
they'll
just
bringing
rockroll
with
them!!!
lmfao!!!!
imagine
grand
ol﻿
oprey
and
they
just
finish
playing
a
smash
hit
like
satisfaction
or
rock

roll
(and
i
like
it)
then
boom
the
curtains
will
close
and
the
rolling
stones
and
rock
and
roll
will
go
down
with
them!!!!!!!!!!
the
death
of
a
whole
era!!!!!!!!!
the
stones
baby!!!!
