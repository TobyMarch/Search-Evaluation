summary

this
story
tells
the
fictional
tale
of
a
german
commando
unit
that
attempts
to
kidnap
winston
churchill
during
world
war
ii
the
book
employs
the
“story
within
a
story”
method
and
begins
with
jack
higgins
(as
himself)
seemingly
discovering
the
facts
behind
the
unknown
mission
after
finding
the
hidden
graves
of
13
german
paratroopers
at
an
english
graveyard
curious
he
begins
asking
the
local
townsfolk
and
their
reactions
make
him
suspect
that
there
is
a
great
secret
being
hidden
from
the
world
after
further
investigation
the
rest
of
the
story
is
higgins
recounting
what
he
has
pieced
together
through
a
combination
of
documentary
evidence
and
educated
guesswork
i
thought
this
was
a
very
high
quality
book
i
found
it
to
be
a
very
well
written
story
and
i
have
zero
complaints
about
the
strength
of
higgins'
prose
in
addition
i
think
higgins
did
an
extremely
good
job
of
creating
three
dimensional
nuanced
characters
that
came
to
life
and
appear
completely
human
(including
the
german
soldiers
but
more
on
that
in
a
minute)
finally
higgins
did
an
fabulous
job
of
constructing
a
well
thought
out
highly
detailed
and
credible
plot
in
other
words
this
has
all
the
makings
of
an
excellent
novel
as
the
vast
number
of
excellent
reviews
of
this
book
can
easily
attest
so
why
didn’t
steve
love
this
book
(an
answer
in
4
parts)
so
given
all
that
slobbering
fanboyish
praise
why
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
good
and
holy
did
i
give
this
only
20
stars??
first
please
stop
yelling
at
me
and
i
will
tell
you
see
as
good
as
i
thought
the
novel
was
on
a
technical
level
i
found
the
story
itself
fairly
dry
at
the
best
of
times
and
actually
quite
boring
at
the
worst
of
times
now
boring
or
dry
when
dealing
with
nonfiction
or
even
classics
may
still
earn
3
stars
(or
higher)
if
they
impart
deeper
meaning
or
just
load
you
up
with
knowledge
however
fiction
is
different
i
read
that
to
enjoy
myself
and
so
dry
and
boring
become
tough
hurdles
to
overcome
here
are
my
four
main
gripes
1
one
of
the
reasons
higgins
cites
for
the
popularity
of
the
book
in
his
introduction
is
that
it
was
the
first
time
that
regular
german
soldiers
(as
distinguished
from
those
within
the
nazi
hierarchy)
were
portrayed
in
fiction
as
human
beings
and
not
bloodthirsty
monsters
while
the
portrayal
of
german
soldiers
as
regular
people
is
certainly
laudable
i
must
disagree
that
higgins
was
a
trailblazer
in
this
area
long
before
this
book
was
evedwritten
the
world
had
been
introduced
to
the
following
two
loveable
scamps
and
how
do
you
not
love
klink
and
schultzie?
so
sorry
mr
higgins
but
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
hogan
and
his
band
of
heroes
beat
you
to
the
punch
as
far
the
“humanization
of
the
german
solider”
is
concerned
thus
no
points
for
groundbreaking
cultural
revelations
2
the
fact
that
the
final
outcome
of
the
story
was
known
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
story
took
away
much
of
the
suspense/mystery
for
me
now
this
is
not
always
the
case
when
reading
about
real
life
events
in
which
the
final
outcome
is
well
known
as
i
have
read
a
lot
of
historical
ficiton
and
real
life
crime
fiction
that
kept
me
at
the
edge
of
my
seat
however
in
this
case
the
slow
methodical
planning
of
the
kidnapping
just
never
seemed
to
pull
me
in
and
so
i
found
the
story
very
slow
moving
3
there
were
nonadazero
omg
moments
in
the
story
which
is
a
real
let
down
for
me
as
i
would
have
expected
some
in
a
taut
thriller
of
this
kind
for
me
omg
moments
are
those
moments
that
raise
goose
bumps
on
your
skin
(eg
jack
nicholson
on
the
stand
in
a
few
good
men)
or
something
that
happens
that
makes
you
say
no
way
did
that
just
happen
(eg
for
those
that
have
seen
the
blair
witch
project

the
final
scene
made
me
almost
crap
my
pants)
basically
they
are
memorable
scenes
that
stick
to
my
brain
long
after
i
have
forgotten
everything
else
about
the
book
movie
etc
this
book
did
not
have
a
single
moment
that
will
stay
with
me
for
more
than
10
minutes
after
i
finish
this
review
thus
no
point
there
4
finally
while
most
of
the
characters
were
well
drawn
there
wasn’t
what
i
would
call
any
real
standout
“memorable”
character
this
is
closely
tied
to
#3
above
liam
devlin
the
ira
commando
comes
closest
and
is
certainly
a
good
character
however
when
i
finished
the
book
i
wasn’t
anxious
to
pick
up
the
sequel
and
find
out
what
liam
would
do
next
he
just
didn't
stir
the
curious
in
me
final
thoughts
so
i
didn't
love
this
book
i
thought
it
was
okay
sometimes
when
i
dislike
a
book
that
the
majority
of
my
fellow
readers
rate
highly
i
will
either
be
thinking
to
myself
‘what
the
hell
were
those
people
hopped
up
to
rate
this
dung
pile
so
highly
and
how
can
i
score
me
some
of
that’
or
i'll
be
thinking
‘okay
i'm
the
dung
pile
and
must
have
missed
something
or
banged
my
head
to
hard
as
a
child
because
i
seem
to
be
clearly
mistaken
on
this
one’
well
in
this
case
i
don’t
think
it's
either
(though
my
status
as
a
dung
pile
is
certainly
open
to
daily
reinterpretation)
i
completely
understand
how
someone
can
love
this
book
and
at
the
same
time
am
very
comfortable
with
my
“it
was
just
okay”
assessment
so
for
all
of
the
above
reasons
i
just
never
found
myself
pulled
into
this
one
there
were
some
parts
i
liked
and
it
certainly
had
some
moments
but
there
were
not
enough
of
the
goodies
for
me
to
be
able
to
say
i
liked
it

of

(though
himmler
and
some
of

throughout
the
novel)
i
enjoyed
the
premise
as
well
even
though
it’s
obviously
something
that
will
fail
in
the
end
the
mark
of
a
good
book
like
this
is
how
the
tale
is
told
right?
there
was
a
point
that
the
leadup

the
operation
was
getting
a

wearisome

once

operation
started
my

picked

was
anticlimatic
the
last
3rd
of
the
book
was
great
it
was
just
getting
there
that

3

of

the
story
of
the

concerns
an
attempt
to
kidnap
churchill
during
the
war
by
a
group
of
paratroopers
dropped
on
the
north
norfolk
coast
after
german
intelligence
learns
that
he
is
to
be
staying
in
a
manor
house
there
after
making
a
speech
in
kings
lynn
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
produce
a
propaganda
victory
that
will
shock
the
allies
into
the
negotiation
of
peace
as
the
possibility
of
a
german
victory
looks
more
and
more
remote
the
eagle
has
landed
succeeds
because
the
idea
is
interesting
a
reversal
of
the
plot
of
many
thrillers
about
british
soe
style
operations
(such
as
the
guns
of
navarone)
and
the
characters
are
not
just
stereotypes
from
the
norfolk
villagers
to
the
german
paratroops
the
ira
man
and
the
boerborn
spy
who
are
the
ground
contacts
for
the
germans
these
last
two
are
a
nice
touch
a
reminder
that
not
all
those
who
were
apparently
british
were
patriotically
devoted
to
the
war
effort
(there
is
also
a
member
of
the
british
frei
korps
the
ss
regiment
of
renegade
british
troops
who
is
dropped
with
the
paratroopers)
none
of
them
are
the
standard
characters
who
populate
second
world
war
thrillers
an
example
of
different
behaviour
from
the
norm
is
that
the
eventual
failure
of
the
plot
stems
from
one
of
the
paratroopers
diving
into
the
mill
stream
to
save
a
child
and
having
his
german
uniform
exposed
(it
is
worn
under
a
polish
special
unit
one
in
an
attempt
to
get
around
the
geneva
convention
which
specifies
that
fighting
in
the
uniform
of
the
enemy
is
forbidden)
the
novel
is
not
without
flaws
including
what
seem
to
be
small
errors
in
a
generally
wellresearched
background
the
idea
that
such
a
raid
would
have
a
massive
effect
on
the
war
is
perhaps
a
little
farfetched
though
its
propaganda
value
would
no
doubt
be
huge
the
final
twist
i
find
massively
unconvincing
it
would
be
impossible
to
explain
why
without
giving
it
away
some
terms
are
used
with
an
anachronistic
reference
the
title
being
an
example
its
resonance
is
principally
with
the
apollo
moon
landings
the
eagle
has
landed
nevertheless
remains
one
of
the
all
time
classics
of
the
thriller
genre
and
continues
to
be
exciting

for
a
freelance
article
he's
writing
for
a
nautical
magazine
in
the
course
of
this
he
stumbles
across
a
hidden
gravestone
from
1943
engraved
with
the
names
and
ranks
of
a
platoon
of
german
paratroopers
when
the
local
churchman
attempts
to
run
him
off
the
property
he
is
determined
to
dig
deeper
and
so
unwraps
the
secret
tale
of
german
paratroopers
sent
to
abduct
winston
churchill
apparently
higgins
felt
there
were
a
lack
of
englishlanguage
books
that
portrayed
german
soldiers
in
world
war
ii
as
anything
other
than
foamingatthemouth
nazis
and
wished
to
present
a
more
balanced
depiction
in
keeping
with
his
own
experience
the
idea
was
to
present
a
thrilling
scheme
organized
and
conducted
by
largely
sympathetic
professional
german
soldiers
with
the
help
of
somewhat
less
sympathetic
but
nonetheless
engaging
traitorous
helpmates
indeed
the
backgrounds
of
these
two
traitors

one
is
an
ira
hit
man
the
other
a
boer
widow

is
none
too
subtly
calibrated
to
highlight
the
injustice
and
cruelty
of
british
imperial
rule
although
the
ira
man
probably
has
the
most
time
on
the
page
(and
indeed
returns
in
five
more
books
by
higgins)
there's
no
protagonist
as
such
and
the
cast
includes
a
bevy
of
german
intelligence
officers
a
village
full
of
typical
stolid
citizens
and
a
unit
of
american
troops
commanded
by
a
kind
of
loose
cannon
(presumably
meant
to
illustrate
the
ill
discipline
of
the
american
cousins)
not
to
mention
the
german
commando
unit
itself
everyone
is
kind
of
a
stock
character
without
very
much
depth
but
that's
pretty
much
ok
for
a
thriller
like
this
the
book's
opening
graveyard
scene
appears
to
be
a
direct
nod
to
the
1943
film
when
the
day
went
well
(itself
based
on
a
graham
greene
short
called
the
lieutenant
died
last)
which
also
opens
in
a
small
english
village
graveyard
with
a
memorial
to
a
platoon
of
german
paratroopers
that
story
and
film
which
posit
a
small
force
bent
on
sabotage
must
have
clearly
inspired
higgins
who
then
raised
the
stakes
to
the
highest
possible
level
in
his
version
on
the
whole
the
book
is
a
pretty
fun
read
and
very
well
paced
with
the
action
moving
back
and
forth
between
the
various
players
involved
(including
himmler)
it
does
get
a
little
heavyhanded
at
times
especially
the
scene
in
which
the
true
identity
of
the
germans
is
revealed
but
it's
all
pretty
ingenious
and
wellexecuted
fun
chock
full
of
interesting
little
details
such
as
the
british
freikorps
and
things
like

first
thought
was
literally
hey
i
know
those
guys!)
and
i
can't
say
i
predicted
that
last
twist
so
the
book
does
have
that
going
for
it
but
still
i
can't
say
this
will
make
it
into
my
list
of
favourites
to
sum
up
read

micah
rated
it
good
book
as
far
as
plot
and
suspense
however
there
was
some
language
violence
and
a
mention
of
immorality
no
more
than
a
pg
(or
light
pg13)
movie
would
have
but
it
was
still
there
also
it
was
kind
of
weird
to
read
a
book
about
a
historical
event
that
you
already
know
the
outcome
much
less
suspense
at
some
points
it
seems
to
be
a
soap
box
of
how
not
all
german
soldiers
were
evil
a
valid
point
but
who
wants
to
read
a
soap
box?
overall
i
liked
it
but
would
not
really
recommend
it

review
of
another
edition
you
have
to
read
this
one
it
is
my
favorite
higgins
thriller
and
his
best
i
have
read
nearly
all
of
his
books
and
though
the
quality
lessens
book
after
book
he
continues
to
entertain
me
it
was
to
become
known
as
the
most
daring
enemy
mission
of
the
entire
war
operation
eagle

rated
it
although
written
in
1975
this
story
stands
the
test
of
time
the
story
is
told
by
the
germans
and
makes
for
an
excellent
wwii
suspense
novel
filled
with
spies
irish
rebels
honorable
prussian
soldiers
nazis
english
country
folk
and
american
rangers
stationed
in
england
all
these
characters
are
intriguing
and
fully
developed
they
make
the
story
engrossing
even
though
you
know
how
it
will
all
come
out
in
the
end
i
really
enjoyed
this
book

it's
a
page
turner!

rachel

rated
it
a
classic
i'm
putting
this
on
my
bookshelf
as
it
was
the
first
adult
book
i
read
at
12
years
old

i'd
always
seen
it
on
my
grandad's
bookshelf
and
wanted
to
read
it
so
one
long
weekend
it
was
handed
to
me
i
became
absolutely
engrossed
it's
one
of
those
books
that
you
can
reread
every
few
years
and
still
get
lost
in
the
characters
and
the
plot
and
a
great
introduction
for
anyone
that
isn't
familiar
with
this
author's
books

kevin
rated
it
in
the
first
chapter
you
learn
that
the
german
mission
fails
don't
see
this
as
a
spoiler
since
you
learn
it
at
the
very
beginning
anyway
why
press
on
when
you
know
how
the
story
will
end
anyway?
because
as
you
continue
to
follow
the
german's
well
laid
plans
you
ask
yourself
how
will
it
fail?
you
want
to
find
out
what
goes
disastrously
wrong
of
course
the
book
does
end
with
a
clever
twist
which
i
wont
share
here

i
absolutely
loved
this
book
it
gave
me
the
same
feeling
as
a
good
clive
cussler
novel
or
even
angels
and
demons
it
expertly
blended
historical
fiction
into
a
thriller
novel
with
just
enough
truth
and
fact
in
it
to
make
you
wonder
did
this
really
happen
another
captivating
read
that
i
highly
recommend
to
anyone

judy
rated
it
i
enjoyed
this
book
especially
for
its
historical
interest
i
had
read
a
brad
thor
book
refering
to
the
rescue
of
mussolini
by
hitler
during
wwii
and
wanted
to
read
about
his
desire
to
carry
out
another
daring
event
and
kidnap
churchill
i
watched
the
movie
afterward
and
felt
that
the
book
was
much
better
and
preferred
the
book's
ending
to
that
of
movie
which
was
not
as
satisfying
