storyline
dom
cobb
is
a
skilled
thief
the
absolute
best
in
the
dangerous
art
of
extraction
stealing
valuable
secrets
from
deep
within
the
subconscious
during
the
dream
state
when
the
mind
is
at
its
most
vulnerable
cobb's
rare
ability
has
made
him
a
coveted
player
in
this
treacherous
new
world
of
corporate
espionage
but
it
has
also
made
him
an
international
fugitive
and
cost
him
everything
he
has
ever
loved
now
cobb
is
being
offered
a
chance
at
redemption
one
last
job
could
give
him
his
life
back
but
only
if
he
can
accomplish
the
impossibleinception
instead
of
the
perfect
heist
cobb
and
his
team
of
specialists
have
to
pull
off
the
reverse
their
task
is
not
to
steal
an
idea
but
to
plant
one
if
they
succeed
it
could
be
the
perfect
crime
but
no
amount
of
careful
planning
or
expertise
can
prepare
the
team
for
the
dangerous
enemy
that
seems
to
predict
their
every
move
an
enemy
that
only
cobb
could
have
seen

did
you
know?
trivia
the
role
of
saito
was
written
exclusively
for
ken
watanabe
because
christopher
nolan
felt
that
although
he
had
appeared
in
batman
begins
he
did
not
have
much
screen
time
and
should
therefore
be
given
a
more
prominent
supporting
role
see

goofs
revealing
mistakes
when
saito
uses
his
teeth
to
pull
the
safety
pin
from
a
fragmentation
grenade
(extremely
difficult
in
real
life)
the
safety
lever
remains
in
place
even
after
the
grenade
is
thrown
several
feet
into
the
opening
of
