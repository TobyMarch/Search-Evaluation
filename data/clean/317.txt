the
da
vinci
code
a
popular
suspense
novel
by
dan
brown
generated
criticism
and
controversy
after
its
publication
in
2003
many
of
the
complaints
centered
on
the
book's
speculations
and
alleged
misrepresentations
of
core
aspects
of
christianity
and
the
history
of
the
roman
catholic
church
additional
criticisms
were
directed
towards
the
book's
inaccurate
descriptions
of
european
art
history
architecture
and
geography[1]
charges
of
copyright
infringement
were
also
leveled
by
the
authors
of
the
1982
pseudohistory
book
the

and

brown
was

that

the
novel
is
a
work
of
fiction
the
historical
information
in
it
is
all
accurate
and
wellresearched
for
example
martin

when
we
talk
about
da
vinci
and
your
book
how
much
is
true
and
how
much
is
fabricated
in
your
storyline?
dan

99
percent
of
it
is
true
all
of
the
architecture
the
art
the
secret
rituals
the
history
all
of
that
is
true
the
gnostic
gospels
all
of
that
is
…
all
that
is
fiction
of
course
is
that
there's
a
harvard
symbologist
named
robert
langdon
and
all
of
his
action
is
fictionalized
but
the
background
is
all
true[3]
matt
lauer
how
much
of
this
is
based
on
reality
in
terms
of
things
that
actually
occurred?
dan
brown
absolutely
all
of
it
obviously
there
are—robert
langdon
is
fictional
but
all
of
the
art
architecture
secret
rituals
secret
societies
all
of
that
is
historical
fact[4]
these
claims
in
the
book
and
by
the
author
combined
with
the
presentation
of
religious
opinions
that
some
regard
as
offensive
have
caused
a
great
deal
of
debate
and
partisan
material
to
erupt
this
confusion
has
overlapped
into
real
politics
for
example
a

article
in

independent

2006
stated
that
ruth

senior
british

mary
magdalene
the
novel
asserts
that
mary
magdalene
was
of
the
tribe
of
benjamin
but
historians
dispute
this
claim
and
there
is
no
mention
of
this
in
the
bible
or
in
other
ancient
sources
according
to
sandra
miesel
and
carl
e
olson
writing
in
their
2004
book
the
da
vinci
hoax
the
fact
that
magdala
was
located
in
northern
israel
whereas
the
tribe
of
benjamin
resided
in
the
south
weighs
against
it[6]
in
chapter
58
it
is
suggested
that
the
marriage
of
jesus
and
mary
magdalene
created
a
potent
political
union
with
the
potential
of
making
a
legitimate
claim
to
the
throne[7]
olson
and
meisel
not
only
state
that
this
assertion
is
without
any
historical
basis
but
question
why
solomon's
kingship
would
have
any
purpose
or
meaning
today
that
would
motivate
a
largescale
conspiracy
the
authors
also
question
why
if
jesus
were
merely
a
mortal
prophet
as
the
novel
suggests
would
a
royal
goddess
have
any
interest
in
him
olson
and
meisel
quote
chicago
archbishop
francis
cardinal
george
who
remarked
jesus
isn't
god
but
mary
magdalene
is
a
goddess?
i
mean
what
does
that
mean?
if
he's
not
god
why
is
he
married
to
a
goddess?
olson
and
meisel
also
argued
that
having
davidic
blood
in
jesus'
time
would
not
have
been
unique
since
all
of
his
stepfather
joseph's
relatives
which
included
twenty
generations
of
kings
of
judah
had
it
as
well
the
authors
also
state
that
the
benjamites
were
not
considered
rightful
heirs
to
the
throne
and
that
the
new
testament
does
not
mention
mary
magdalene's
tribal
affiliation
and
that
she
was
likely
not
from
the
tribe
of
benjamin
and
that
her
connection
with
that
tribe
is
traced
to
holy
blood
holy
grail
which
does
not
substantiate
the
idea[6]
characters
in
the
book
also
claim
that
mary
magdalene
was
labeled
a
prostitute
by
the
church[8]
while
catholic
tradition
in
the
past
defended
these
integrations
in
contrast
to
other
christian
traditions[9]
these
claims
are
now
rejected
by
the
majority
of
biblical
scholars
catholic
and
noncatholic
alike
according
to
carol
ann
morrow
of
americancatholicorg[10][11]
also
gregory
i's
teaching
about
mary
magdalene
though
popular
throughout
much
of
the
church's
history
was
never
formally
integrated
into
catholic
dogma
nor
was
he
speaking
ex
cathedra
at
the
time
so
his
speech
is
not
seen
as
infallible
whatever
weight
is
given
to
this
tradition
however
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
was
used
to
defame
mary
who
was
considered
a
saint
to
whose
honor
churches
were
built
she
is
also
respected
as
a
witness
to
christ's
resurrection
as
written
in
the
gospels[6]
alleged
marriage
to
jesus
the
story
claims
the
holy
grail
is
not
a
chalice
but
a
bloodline
sprung
from
the
marital
union
of
jesus
and
mary
magdalene
this
idea
is
not
original
to
brown
it
was
previously
hypothesized
by
others
including
michael
baigent
and
richard
leigh
in
their
nonfiction
1982
book
the
holy
blood
and
the
holy
grail
many
textual
and
historical
scholars
have
characterized
this
claim
as
being
without
evidence[12]
women
in
the
gospels
were
usually
identified
with
husbands
or
male
relatives
especially
if
they
shared
their
names
with
others
for
example
there
are
many
mentions
of
women
called
mary
all
designated
differently
(any
possible
identification
with
each
other
nonwithstanding)
there
is
mary
the
mother
of
jesus
mary
magdalene
mary
the
mother
of
james
and
joses
mary
[the
mother]
of
james
the
other
mary
mary
the
wife
of
cl[e]opas
and
mary
of
bethany
the
sister
of
lazarus
and
martha
mary
magdalene
stands
out
from
most
of
the
other
marys
as
she
is
not
directly
associated
with
any
man
mary
magdalene
means
mary
of
magdala
just
as
jesus
the
nazarene
means
jesus
of
nazareth
some
researchers
have
claimed
that
if
indeed
she
was
married
to
jesus
she
should
have
been
designated
following
custom
mary
the
wife
of
jesus
instead[13]
according
to
the
da
vinci
hoax
the
use
of
the
term
bride
of
christ
for
the
church
in
some
of
the
letters
of
paul
(ephesians
525–27
2
corinthians
112–3)
and
the
book
of
revelation
suggests
that
jesus
was
not
married
the
authors
of
that
work
also
speculate
that
the
recorded
words
of
jesus
that
those
people
who
can
remain
celibate
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven's
sake
should
do
so
(matt
1912)
were
made
in
response
to
criticisms
of
his
own
celibacy[6]
in
the
novel
a
line
of
the
gospel
of
philip
is
quoted
where
mary
magdalene
is
referred
to
as
jesus's
companion
and
a
character
of
the
da
vinci
code
says
that
aramaic
scholars
know
that
this
means
wife
james
m
robinson
an
authority
on
the
gnostic
gospels
has
responded
to
this
passage
by
pointing
out
that
companion
was
not
necessarily
a
sexrelated
term
in
addition
the
gospel
of
philip
is
in
coptic
translated
from
greek
so
there
is
no
word
in
the
text
for
aramaic
scholars
to
consider
the
gospel
of
philip
depicts
mary
as
jesus's
koinonos
a
greek
term
indicating
a
'close
friend'
'companion'
or
potentially
a
lover
in
context
of
gnostic
beliefs
gnostic
writings
use
mary
to
illustrate
a
disciple's
spiritual
relationship
with
jesus
making
any
physical
relationship
irrelevant[6]
however
the
presentation
of
a
fourth
century
papyrus
fragment
containing
a
gospel
dating
from
the
2nd
century)
called
the
gospel
of
jesus'
wife
at
the
international
congress
of
coptic
studies
in
rome
on
september
18
2012
by
karen
l
king
may
fuel
the
idea
that
early
christians
believed
that
jesus
was
married
as
jesus
refers
to
my
wife
in
the
script[14][15]
mary
in
leonardo's
the
last
supper
the
last
supper
virtually
all
art
historians
dispute
that
leonardo's
famous
the
last
supper
depicts
mary
magdalene
beside
jesus[16]
according
to
artist
and
art
writer
shelley
esaak
of
aboutcom
the
femininity
of
the
figure
can
be
attributed
to
leonardo's
artistic
training
in
a
workshop
of
the
florentine
school
which
had
a
long
tradition
of
often
depicting
young
males
in
an
effeminate
manner[17]
some
speculators
before
and
after
brown
have
entertained
the
idea
that
john
was
depicted
in
this
way
to
hint
that
he
was
mary
magdalene
but
esaak
disputes
this
idea[18]
another
explanation
concerns
the
biblical
scene
leonardo
intended
to
depict
scholars
have
suggested
that
the
text
the
artist
had
in
mind
was
john
1321
where
jesus
announces
that
one
of
his
disciples
will
betray
him
the
scene
depicted
therefore
shows
the
disciples
reactions
to
jesus'
words
and
the
figure
of
john
can
be
seen
leaning
over
to
confer
with
peter
seated
further
to
his
right
furthermore
in
the
gospel
of
john
jesus
does
not
institute
the
eucharist
(identifying
bread
and
wine
with
his
own
body
and
blood)
at
the
last
supper
and
may
have
led
the
artist
to
think
that
the
inclusion
of
a
chalice
was
not
necessary
as
it
was
not
spoken
of
in
his
chosen
passage
of
scripture
jesus
in
church
teaching
according
to
sir
leigh
teabing
in
chapter
55
of
the
novel
the
early
church
consolidated
its
power
by
suppressing
ideas
about
the
sacred
feminine
and
declaring
the
mortal
prophet
jesus
into
a
divine
being
according
to
religion
facts
the
questions
discussed
by
the
council
were
not
whether
he
was
divine
as
the
new
testament
authors
already
believe
that
he
was
but
what
his
precise
relationship
to
god
was
in
particular
the
council
decided
upon
the
question
of
whether
jesus
was
homoousios
of
one
substance
with
god
the
father
or
whether
instead
jesus
was
the
first
created
being
inferior
to
the
father
but
like
him
but
still
superior
to
all
other
beings
(see
arianism
homoios)
or
whether
he
was
merely
of
like
substance
to
the
father
or
homoiousios[19][20]
portrayal
of
gnostic
christianity
the
novel
claims
constantine
wanted
christianity
to
unify
the
roman
empire
but
thought
it
would
appeal
to
pagans
only
if
it
featured
a
demigod
similar
to
pagan
heroes
so
he
destroyed
the
gnostic
gospels
that
said
jesus
was
a
human
prophet
and
promoted
the
gospels
of
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
which
portray
jesus
as
divine[21]
historically
however
gnostic
christianity
did
not
portray
jesus
as
merely
human
in
fact
the
gnostic
jesus
was
less
human
than
the
jesus
of
orthodox
christianity
while
orthodox
christianity
generally
considered
christ
both
divine
and
human
many
gnostic
sects
considered
christ
purely
divine
his
human
body
being
a
mere
illusion
(see
docetism)
many
gnostics
saw
matter
as
evil
and
believed
that
a
divine
spirit
would
never
have
taken
on
a
material
body[22][23][24]
some
varieties
of
gnosticism
went
so
far
as
to
hold
that
the
god
of
the
jews
is
only
a
demiurge
who
has
trapped
humanity
in
a
fleshly
prison
and
that
christ
is
an
emanation
of
the
true
god
sent
to
free
humanity
from
that
bondage
to
the
flesh
(see
marcionism
aeon
archon)
the
sacred
feminine
characters
in
the
book
claim
christianity
has
suppressed
the
sacred
feminine
the
representation
of
the
earth
or
mother
goddess's
mystic
power
that's
often
linked
to
symbols
of
fertility
and
reproduction
brown
primarily
discusses
venus
and
isis[citation
needed]
early
christian
devotion
to
female
martyrs
(such
as
perpetua
and
felicity)
and
the
apocryphal
writings
about
figures
like
st
thecla
seem
to
indicate
that
women
did
play
a
role
in
the
early
church
far
more
than
either
brown
or
some
modern
critics
of
christianity
acknowledge
though
historical
evidence
does
not
suggest
men
and
women
shared
all
roles
of
office[6]
the
catholic
and
orthodox
churches
particularly
venerate
the
virgin
mary
who
gave
birth
to
jesus
but
the
book
deems
this
a
desexualised
aspect
of
femininity
that
suppresses
the
sacred
feminine
brown
echoes
scholars
such
as
joseph
campbell
in
saying
this
image
of
mary
derives
from
isis
and
her
child
horus[25]
meisel
and
olson
counters
that
the
mother
and

symbol
as
a
universal
part
of
the
general
human
experience
can
be
found
in
other
faiths
so
christianity
did
not
copy
this
element
from
egyptian
mythology[6]
christian
documents
and
traditions
tend
to
stress
the
virtues
of
chaste
womanhood
in
keeping
with
general
christian
encouragement
of
chastity
for
both
genders
the
gnostics
expressed
antifemale
views
for
example
in
the
gospel
of
thomas's
famous
ending
verse
where
jesus
says
he
will
make
mary
into
a
male
to
make
her
worthy
to
enter
the
kingdom[6]
goddess
worship
israelites
while
the
character
robert
langdon
claims
in
the
book
that
early
israelites
worshipped
the
goddess
shekinah
as
yahweh's
equal
in
fact
the
term
shekinah
(derived
from
hebrew
for
dwelling)
does
not
appear
in
early
judaism
at
all
but
later
talmudic
judaism
used
it
to
refer
to
the
god's
dwelling
or
presence
among
his
people
the
term
describes
a
spiritual
radiance[26]
critics
argue
that
this
comes
from
a
distorted
understanding
of
kabbalah
which
speaks
of
god
as
having
male
and
female
attributes
in
the
sephirot[6]
see

asherah
medieval
christian
history

character
teabing
states
in
the
story
that
the
church
burned
at
the
stake
five
million
women
as
witches
researcher
mark
hansard
states
that
most
modern
scholars
believe
that
between
50000
to
200000
were
killed
in
this
manner
and
argues
that
many
of
these
were
men
as
well
as
women
as
the
primary
motivation
for
these
persecutions

religious
and
was
not
genderspecific
even
if

was
a

susceptible
to
the
temptation
of

the
bible
carl
olson
and
sandra
miesel
state
that
contrary
to
the
book's
claims
the
gnostic
gospels
(eg
the
gospels
of
thomas
philip
mary
magdalene
and
the
judas)
also
do
not
focus
more
on
jesus'
humanity
the
other
gospels
we
are
aware
of
for
the
most
part
treat
jesus
as
more
otherworldly
and
lack
the
humanizing
detail
of
the
biblical
accounts[6]
the
assertion
of
more
than
eighty
gospels
written
with
only
the
familiar
four
chosen
as
canonical
greatly
exaggerates
the
number
of
gnostic
gospels
written[6][13]
the
assertions
that
the
dead
sea
scrolls
discovered
in
1947
(not
the
1950s
as
brown
predicates)
contain
lost
or
hidden
gospels
is
also
false
the
scrolls
contain
books
of
the
hebrew
scriptures
apocryphal
and
pseudepigraphic
books

opus
dei
the
depiction
of
opus
dei
as
a
monastic
order
which
is
the
pope's
personal
prelature
is
inaccurate
in
fact
there
are
no
monks
in
opus
dei
which
has
primarily
lay
membership
and
whose
celibate
lay
members
are
called
numeraries
but
it
may
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
silas
is
referred
to
as
a
monk
mostly
by
the
protagonists
langdon
and
neveu
who
are
shown
to
have
little
knowledge
of
opus
dei
the
word
numerary
is
used
to
refer
to
silas
by
actual
opus
dei
members
such
as
the
person
at
opus
dei
centre
in
london
moreover
opus
dei
encourages
its
lay
members
to
avoid
practices
that
are
perceived
as
fundamentalist
to
the
outside
world
the
term
personal
prelature
does
not
refer
to
a
special
relationship
to
the
pope
it
means
an
institution
in
which
the
jurisdiction
of
the
prelate
is
not
linked
to
a
territory
but
over
persons
wherever
they
be[6]
silas
the
murderous
opus
dei
monk
uses
a
cilice
and
flagellates
himself
some
members
of
opus
dei
do
practice
voluntary
mortification
of
the
flesh
as
has
been
a
christian
tradition
since
at
least
st
anthony
in
the
3rd
century
and
has
also
been
practised
by
mother
teresa
padre
pio
and
slain

romero
saint
thomas
more
and
catherine
of
aragon
queen
of

both

in
the
tudor
era[28]
critics
have
accused
the
book
of
depicting
the
order
as
misogynistic
a
claim
which
the
order's
defenders
say
has
no
basis
in
reality
because
half
of
the
leadership
positions
in
opus
dei
are
held
by
women[28]
defenders
also
say
that
the
novel's
allegations
of
dealings
between
john
paul
ii
and
the
order
concerning
the
vatican
bank
also
have
no
basis

josemar&iacutea
escriv&aacute
was
canonized
27
years
after
his
death
admittedly
faster
than
some
others—but
this
is
attributed
to
streamlining
of
the
whole
process
and
john
paul

decision
to
make

sanctity
and

known[28]
in

the

is
usually
accompanied

historical
disputes
leonardo
da
vinci
the
contention
that
the
mona
lisa
was
painted
by
leonardo
as
an
androgynous
whole
humanity
that
represented
both
genders
is
contested
by
olson
and
meisel's
book
in
which
they
state
that
reputable
art
historians
have
explained
that
it
is
simply
a
masterful
portrait
of
a
woman
olson
and
meisel
also
take
issue
with
the
idea
that
leonardo
painted
the
mona
lisa
as
a
selfportrait
and
that
this
idea
is
based
on
the
fact
that
points
of
congruency
are
found
between
leonardo's
face
and
the
mona
lisa's
olson
and
meisel
respond
that
points
of
congruency
can
be
found
among
many
faces
which
is
how
computer
morphing
of
faces
is
facilitated[6]
one
of
the
characters
in
the
da
vinci
code
matteroffactly
states
that
leonardo
da
vinci
was
a
flamboyant
homosexual
while
there
are
clues
about
leonardo's
personal
life
that
could
suggest
he
was
homosexual
these
are
by
no
means
conclusive
nor
is
there
scholarly
agreement
on
the
matter
if
leonardo
were
homosexual
he
must
have
been
rather
discreet
and
certainly
not
flamboyant
in
any
event
it
would
have
been
dangerous
to
be
flamboyant
as
homosexual
sodomy
was
then
usually
punishable
by
death[6]
the
title
of
the
book
is
not
consistent
with
the
naming
convention
of
the
time
leonardo
lived
the
traditional
modern
western
construct
of
first
name
+
surname
is
an
anachronism
in
consideration
of
the
time
of
leonardo
da
vinci
in
historically
accurate
form
leonardo
da
vinci
is
properly
referred
to
as
leonardo
and
not
da
vinci
the
book
would
be
more
properly
titled
the
leonardo
code[29]

the
holy
blood
and
the
holy
grail
main
article
the
holy
blood
and
the
holy
grail
the
legend
of
the
holy
grail
alleged
that
a
sacred
relic
(in
many
versions
either
the
cup
used
at
the
last
supper
or
the
cup
said
to
have
been
used
by
joseph
of
arimathea
to
collect
blood
of
christ
–
or
both)
existed
which
would
bring
untold
blessings
to
any
pure
knight
who
found
it
the
story
appeared
around
the
time
of
the
crusades
and
is
featured
in
thomas
malory's
le
morte
d'arthur
in
old
french
the
holy
grail
was
written
as
san
graal
however
the
da
vinci
code
taking
cues
from
the
holy
blood
and
the
holy
grail
interprets
this
as
sang
r&eacuteal
and
translated
this
as
royal
blood
in
early
grail
romances
graal
in
fact
denotes
a
large
dish
for
fish
itself
a
christian
religious
symbol
but
clearly
removed
from
the
traditional
cup
the
idea
of
a
cup
seems
to
have
developed
quickly
during
the
late
12th
and
early
13th
centuries
influenced
both
by
apocryphal
religious
stories
such
as
that
of
joseph
of
arimathea
and
pagan
stories
involving
magic
containers
that
for
example
produced
endless
food
(itself
a
useful
parallel
to
the
christian
belief
of
the
'bread
of
life'
produced
at
the
last
supper)
the
cup
therefore
presented
a
convenient
fusion
like
many
of
the
stories
we
now
associate
with
the
quest
for
the
holy
grail
and
king
arthur
of
(albeit
apocryphal)
christian
teachings
and
pagan
traditions[6]

several
claims
about
the
church
of
saintsulpice
in
paris
are
disputed
while
there
is
a
brass
line
running
northsouth
through
the
church
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
paris
meridian
the
line
is
instead
more
of
a
gnomon
or
sundial/calendar
meant
to
mark
the

further
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
was

a
temple

on
the

this
note
has
been
on
display
in
the

contrary
to
fanciful
allegations
in
a
recent
bestselling
novel
this
[the
line
in

floor]
is
not
a
vestige
of
a
pagan
temple
no
such
temple
ever
existed
in
this
place
it
was
never
called
a

it
does
not
coincide
with
the

serves
as
a

for

where
longitudes

please
also
note
that
the
letters
p
and
s
in
the
small
round
windows
at
both
ends
of
the
transept
can
also
refer
to
peter

the

of
the
church
[30][31]
the
reference
to
paris
having
been
founded
by
the
merovingians
(chapter
55)
is
false
in
fact
the
city
was
settled
by
gauls
by
the
3rd
century
bc
the
romans
who
knew
it
as
lutetia
captured
it
in
52
bc
under
julius
caesar
and
left
substantial
ruins
in
the
city
including
an
amphitheater
and
public
baths
the
merovingians
did
not
rule
in
france
until
the
5th
century
ad
by
which
time
paris
was
at
least
800
years
old[6]

of
venus
as
trac[ing]
a

this
was

the

living

could
be
the
only
descendants
from
any
particular
person
who
lived
millennia
ago
such
as

is
statistically
flawed
according
to

if

is
descended
from

so
are
most

allegations
of
plagiarism
two
lawsuits
have
been
brought
alleging
plagiarism
in
the
da
vinci
code[36]
on
april
11
2005
novelist
lewis
perdue
sued
brown
and
his
publisher
random
house
for
plagiarizing
his
novels
the
da
vinci
legacy
(1983)
and
daughter
of
god
(2000)
claiming
there
are
far
too
many
parallels
between
my
books
and
the
da
vinci
code
for
it
to
be
an
accident
on
august
4
2005
district
judge
george
b
daniels
granted
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
dismissed
the
suit
ruling
that
a
reasonable
average
lay
observer
would
not
conclude
that
the
da
vinci
code
is
substantially
similar
to
daughter
of
god
any
slightly
similar
elements
are
on
the
level
of
generalized
or
otherwise
unprotectable
ideas
he
affirmed
that
the
da
vinci
code
does
not
infringe
upon
copyrights
held
by
perdue[37]
in
february
2006
michael
baigent
and
richard
leigh
two
of
the
three
authors
of
the
holy
blood
and
the
holy
grail
took
the
uk
publisher
of
the
da
vinci
code
to
court
for
breach
of
copyright
alleging
plagiarism[38]
some
sources
suggested
the
lawsuit
was
a
publicity
stunt[39]
intended
to
boost
sales
of
the
holy
blood
and
the
holy
grail
(a
boost
which
did
in
fact
occur)
however
the
projected
court
costs
of
over
1
million
pounds
outweigh
or
at
least
substantially
reduce
the
financial
benefit
of
the
lawsuit[40]
dan
brown
repeatedly
said
in
his
defense
that
history
cannot
be
plagiarized
and
therefore
the
accusations
of
the
two
authors
were
false
leigh
stated
it's
not
that
dan
brown
has
lifted
certain
ideas
because
a
number
of
people
have
done
that
before
it's
rather
that
he's
lifted
the
whole
architecture
–
the
whole
jigsaw
puzzle
–
and
hung
it
on
to
the
peg
of
a
fictional
thriller[41]
dan
brown
has
admitted
some
of
the
ideas
taken
from
baigent
and
leigh's
work
were
indispensable
to
the
book
but
stated
that
there
were
many
other
sources
also
behind
it
however
he
claimed
that
neither
he
nor
his
wife
had
read
baigent
and
leigh's
book
when
he
produced
his
original
synopsis
of
the
novel[42]
among
michael
baigent
and
richard
leigh's
arguments
were
that
the
given
name
of
the
character
sir
leigh
teabing's
is
the
same
of
richard
leigh's
surname
and
that
teabing
is
an
anagram
of
baigent[43]
on
april
7
2006
high
court
judge
sir
peter
smith
rejected
the
copyrightinfringement
claim
by
michael
baigent
and
richard
leigh
and
random
house
won
the
court
case[44][45]
however
in
the
published
extracts
of
his
judgement[46]
the
judge
criticised
the
nonappearance
of
blythe
brown
and
the
vagueness
of
dan
brown's
evidence
saying
he
has
presented
himself
as
being
a
deep
and
thorough
researcherevidence
in
this
case
demonstrates
that
as
regards
dvc
[the
da
vinci
code]
that
is
simply
not
correct
with
respect
to
historical
lectures
and
that
the
reality
of
his
research
is
that
it
is
superficial[dead

the
judge
also
included
a
code
in
his
judgment
throughout
the
judgment
apparently
random
letters
are
italicised
and
these
form
the

the

characterizing

errors[50]
the

was
rated
as
morally
offensive
by
the

conference
of
catholic
bishops[51]
in

some
catholic
groups
sought

as

on
the
history
of
