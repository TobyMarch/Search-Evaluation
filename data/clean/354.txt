one
reviewer
here
on
amazon
was
right
on
the
money
when
he
said
that
reading
a
novel
by
umberto
eco
instantly
raises
your
iq
by
a
couple
of
points
the
name
of
the
rose
has
been
my
first
encounter
with
eco's
work
and
i
was
for
the
most
part
very
impressed
with
his
skillful
murder
mystery
set
in
a
14th
century
italian
monastery
the
novel
works
on
many
levels
it
is
a
compelling
murder
mystery
as
young
narrator
adso
of
elk
accompanies
the
wise
william
of
baskerville
as
he
uses
logic
and
semiotics
to
not
only
solve
a
murder
mystery
but
to
decipher
labrynths
and
hidden
secrets
of
the
vast
monastery
library
interwoven
with
the
murder
mystery
is
a
virtual
course
on
philosophy
and
late
middle
ages
religion
as
eco
provides
detailed
accounts
of
the
histories
of
various
sects
includes
scholarly
debate
on
topics
such
as
the
poverty
of
christ
and
a
history
of
the
catholic
church
leading
to
the
establishment
of
a
papacy
in
avignon
france
one
is
reminded
of
sherlock
holmes
and
dr
watson
as
william
and
adso
use
logic
and
determination
to
piece
together
numerous
bizarre
deaths
and
occurences
at
the
abbey
while
encountering
obstacles
and
outright
hostility
by
the
abbot
and
his
librarian
to
name
a
couple
the
setting
of
the
novel
and
the
glimpse
into
a
culture
that
few
of
us
can
even
imagine
is
reason
enough
to
read
the
name
of
the
rose
the
book
is
not
without
its
faults
however
i
think
the
book
should
stand
alone
(ie
you
should
not
have
to
buy
a
separate
reader's
guide)
and
i
was
very
frustrated
at
the
numerous
latin
phrases
that
are
included
throughout
the
novel
with
no
translation
perhaps
this
is
more
the
fault
of
the
translator
than
eco
himself
but
it
makes
for
a
difficult
reading
experience
one
does
not
need
to
know
the
meaning
of
every
word
in
the
book
to
follow
the
plot
but
it
is
aggravating
to
stumble
across
paragraphlong
passages
or
insciptions
that
are
completely
foreign
to
most
readers
without
so
much
as
a
footnote
there
are
also
fairly
long
digressions
involving
topics
of
religious
debate
or
history
of
minor
sects
that
in
my
opinion
were
extraneous
and
contributed
little
overall
to
the
success
of
the
novel
however
overall
i
thought
the
novel
was
rewarding
both
informative
and
suspenseful

i'd
like
to
add
to
the
many
reviews
of
this
book
only
a
few
comments
about
the
meaning
of
the
famous
latin
sentence
stat
rosa
pristina
nomine
nomina
nuda
tenemus
literaly
it
can
be
translated
as
the
ancient
rose
subsists
thanks
to
its
name
we
have
only
bare
names
it
is
an
ancient
sentence
often
quoted
by
sc
nominalist
philosophers
of
middle
ages
who
thought
that
our
mind
isn't
able
to
discover
the
true
essence
of
things
and
so
it
isn't
able
a
fortiori
to
have
the
minimum
idea
of
god
in
fact
in
medieval
philosophy
god
was
often
compared
to
the
figure
of
a
rose
the
nominalists
wanted
to
say
with
the
sentence
that
even
god
the
supreme
being
persists
only
through
its
name
ie
persists
upon
an
extremely
frail
thing
names
were
seen
as
simple
flatus
vocis
emission
of
voice
without
value
the
nominalist
philosophers
who
declared
that
even
god
was
a
flatus
vocis
were
condemned
as
heretics
(a
theme
that
recurs
often
in
the
novel)
but
here
the
sentence
isn't
quoted
only
for
its
historical
value
but
also
because
it
can
be
applied
also
to
the
love
of
the
young
monk
adso
he
meets
in
the
monastry
a
young
woman
and
perhaps
falls
in
love
with
her
in
his
mind
she
is
just
the
rose
ie
god
of
whom
he
doesn't
know
the
name
(the
woman
and
adso
speak
different
languages)
it
is
then
a
very
pitiful
and
sad
thing
that
of
the
woman
he
doesn't
know
the
name
because
if
nominalist
theories
were
true
he
won't
be
able
to
keep
with
him
in
his
heart
and
mind
in
his
future
life
and
old
age
the
remembrances
of
that
encounter
and
of
those
days
which
changed
his
life
and
mind
forever
(cf
the
pages
of
the
novel
where
the
old
adso
comments
on
those
evets)

it
is
november
1327
adso
of
melk
the
narrator
has
accompanied
william
of
baskerville
to
a
remote
wealthy
franciscan
abbey
in
the
mountains
of
northern
italy
upon
arriving
william
discovers
that
a
murder
has
taken
place
and
the
body
of
the
monk
adelmo
has
been
discovered
outside
the
abbey
walls
the
abbot
abo
is
very
concerned
and
charges
william
with
solving
the
murders
for
not
only
is
the
safety
of
the
monks
in
jeopardy
a
papal
delegation
from
pope
john
xxii
in
avignon
could
well
use
the
murders
as
an
excuse
for
investigating
the
abbey
something
abo
definitely
wants
to
avoid
by
the
time
the
papal
delegation
led
by
two
inquisitors
arrives
the
situation
at
the
abbey
has
worsened
two
more
monks
are
dead
and
two
more
die
soon
afterward
the
abbot's
worst
fears
are
realized
when
the
papal
inquisitors
learn
he
has
been
sheltering
monks
who
were
once
followers
of
the
condemed
heretic
fra
dolcino
although
the
abott
dismisses
willliam
he
remains
and
a
few
hours
later
the
mystery
is
solved
two
more
monks
have
died
and
the
monastery
has
been
consumed
by
fire
the
name
of
the
rose
is
first
and
foremost
a
mystery
of
the
highest
order
and
it
is
possible
to
enjoy
it
on
that
level
alone
but
it
is
also
a
charming
roman
a
clef
something
i
think
many
readers
have
missed
we
don't
have
to
look
far
to
realize
sherlock
holmes
in
the
guise
of
william
of
baskerville
or
adso
as
dr
watson
the
blind
spaniard
jorge
of
burgos
is
easily
recognized
as
the
argentinian
writer
jorge
luis
borges
eco
also
challenges
us
by
thinly
disguising
figures
from
postwar
italian
politics
as
various
other
members
of
the
abbey
the
figures
in
the
book
thus
correspond
to
other
figures
in
different
books
or
in
real
life
each
figure
also
represents
a
metaphysical
concept
william
reason
adso
mysticism
jorge
evil
and
then
in
true
medieval
fashion
characters
are
thus
pitted
one
against
the
other
as
opposing
forces
i
hate
to
see
comparisons
of
this
marvelous
work
of
literature
to
iain
pears's
an
instance
of
the
fingerpost
the
books
are
as
unlike
as
night
is
to
day
while
an
instance
of
the
fingerpost
goes
to
great
lengths
to
point
out
that
ultimate
truth
does
exist
and
can
indeed
be
realized
the
name
of
the
rose
is
at
its
heart
a
book
about
uncertainty
especially
the
uncertainty
of
truth
in
an
instance
of
the
fingerpost
the
reader
is
asked
to
interpret
a
collection
of
signs
and
symbols
which
when
interpreted
in
the
one
correct
manner
will
inevitably
lead
to
the
identity
and
motive
of
the
criminal
ie
the
truth
in
the
name
of
the
rose
the
search
for
ultimate
truth
is
far
more
ambiguous
near
the
end
of
the
book
william
tells
adso
that
many
hypotheses
false
though
they
may
be
can
still
lead
one
to
a
correct
solution
and
while
certainty
is
what's
pursued
in
an
instance
of
the
fingerpost
certainty
remains
an
impossibility
in
the
name
of
the
rose
as
william
says
to
adso
the
only
truth
lies
in
learning
to
free
ourselves
from
the
insane
passion
for
the
truth
umberto
eco's
strength
lies
in
his
plotting
and
his
layering
his
books
are
like
a
collection
of
boxes
each
one
opening
to
reveal
yet
another
and
another
i
found
no
such
layering
in
an
instance
of
the
fingerpost
and
finally
while
an
instance
of
the
fingerpost
was
certainly
a
phenomenon
the
name
of
the
rose
is
definitely
much
more
this
book
is
literature
a
timeless
classic
to
be
enjoyed
by
many
generations
yet
to
come

great

greatly
enjoyed
this

it

seeing

several
years

kneaded
into
a
coherent
and
captivating
story

stars

a
big
hit
with
the
italians

it
