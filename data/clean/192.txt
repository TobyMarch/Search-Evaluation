formataudio
cd
this
album
is
a
prime
example
of
why
bonham
jones
page

plant
are
legends
in
the
rock

roll
industry
it
has
everything
a
r

r
fan
could
possibly
want
a
bluesy
feel
tight
guitar
riffs
solos
from
the
soul
well
constructed
songs
layers
of
music

passionate
vocals
for
me
the
true
cohesion
comes
from
the
rythym
section
bonham's
drums
drives
the
band
ever
forward
while
jpjones
is
ethereal
on
the
keyboards

perfect
on
the
bass
guitar
there
are
no
duds
on
this
their
sophmore
album
these
are
my
seven
favorites
in
no
particular
order
heartbreaker
opens
with
a
classic
riff
the
midsection
flows
to
an
improvisational
section
with
a
fine
guitar
solo
here
the
lyrics

music
blend
easily
i
have
always
liked
this
one
more
than
the
more
publized
whole
lotta
love
moby
dick
is
a
fine
instrumental
with
bonham's
drum
midsection
carrying
it
living
loving
maid
is
often
paired
in
direct
succession
with
heartbreaker
it's
an
upbeat
rocker
with
a
memorable
riff

a
contagious
melody
the
lemon
song
has
one
great
bass
line
as
jpjones
moves
smoothly
throughout
as
the
crescendo
than
picks
up

takes
flight
what
is
and
what
should
never
be
is
a
very
different
type
of
song
that
is
hard
to
classify
i
have
been
told
by
musicians
that
this
is
one
of
the
harder
zeppelin
songs
to
learn
here
the
interesting
lyrics
play
as
a
melodic
counterpoint
to
plant's
vocals
ramble
on
is
the
driving
other
side
of
the
latter
song
representing
moving
on
from
the
angst
of
love
this
is
one
of
the
most
underated
of
led
zeppelin's
songs
thank
you
clearly
is
the
bands
best
ballad
until
in
through
the
outdoor's
all
my
love
this
one
is
smooth

brings
out
the
romantic
in
the
listener
this
is
one
of
their
three
best
albums
buy
it
you
won't
be
disappointed

the
best
led
zeppelin
album
april
13
2001
by
a
customer
formataudio
cd
after
toiling
the
summer
of
my
14th
year
i
finally
saved
enough
money
to
buy
my
first
turntable
(an
$88
pioneer
which
i
am
pleased
to
say
i
still
own
and
23
years
later
it
runs
like
a
champ)
soon
thereafter
i
began
assembling
my
record
collection
led
zeppelin
ii
was
my
first
purchase
over
time
i
bought
all
the
led
zep
albums
and
listened
to
them
all
until
the
vinyl
was
pretty
well
worn
out
however
led
zep
ii
always
remained
my
favorite
led
zep
album
special
memories
of
led
zep
ii
include
the
time
that
i
invited
a
special
young
lady
over
to
my
house
and
to
impress
her
(dumb
i
know)
i
cranked
up
whole
lotta
love
for
the
guitar
jam
following
the
relatively
quiet
stuff
with
the
violin
bows
only
to
have
most
of
the
speaker
componentry
of
my
father's
hand
built
heathkit
speakers
explode
into
a
useless
spasmodic
pile
of
writhing
twitching
cardboardlike
material
and
coils
it
took
me
about
four
months
to
save
enough
pesos
to
buy
a
new
pair
of
speakers
anyway
on
to
something
amazon
readers
might
find
useful
led
zep
ii
is
a
classic
rock
and
roll
album
but
what
makes
it
particularly
good
is
the
way
each
song
works
so
well
with
the
songs
around
it
i've
noticed
other
reviewers
have
made
similar
comments
you
could
not
pull
this
material
and
drop
it
into
a
greatest
hits
album
and
have
it
work
imagine
going
from
whole
lotta
love
straight
into
stairway
to
heaven!
no
way!
another
key
is
to
have
the
right
stereo
equipment
it
is
my
opinion
that
stereo
equipment
is
designed
to
complement
the
music
of
the
day
hence
one
would
be
best
served
to
find
a
vintage
amplifier
or
receiver
to
play
this
music
you
don't
want
some
amplifieronachip
setup
also
milquetoast
speakers
are
out
a
simple
rule
of
thumb
is
if
you
can
lift
your
speakers
they
are
insufficient
for
this
album
one
negative
the
sound
quality
on
led
zep
ii
is
pretty
poor
not
as
dreadful
as
on
led
zep
i
but
not
up
to
today's
standards
of
course
michelangelo's
cracked
and
faded
painting
of
the
sistine
chapel
doesn't
exactly
exhibit
the
highest
signaltonoise
ratio
ever
but
it's
still
a
classic
the
reason
why
i
bring
this
up
is
because
i
just
bought
the
digitally
remastered
cd
to
replace
my
older
original
cd
version
of
led
zep
ii
in
doing
side
by
side
comparisons
the
improvement
in
sound
quality
is
remarkable
particularly
in
the
quiet
parts
of
moby
dick
the
background
hiss
of
the
older
cd
is
much
more
apparent
than
in
the
new
hiss
is
still
there
but
much
less
noticeable
for
purists
the
new
mixing
does
not
eradicate
the
rawness
of
the
original
bottom
line
if
you
own
led
zep
ii
but
in
the
older
cd
version
or
god
forbid
on
vinyl
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
upgrade
it's
worth
the
money
finally
the
obligatory
ranking
of
my
favorite
led
zep
albums
in
order
ii
i
iv
houses
of
the
holy
physical

cd
after
their
ground
breaking
debut
album
led
zeppelin
quickly
followed
the
album
up
with
led
zeppelin
ii
whereas
their
debut
contained
a
few
blues
covers
and
longer
jams
ii
is
a
much
tighter
affair
jimmy
page
was
a
master
at
coming
up
with
memorable
guitar
riffs
and
they
abound
throughout
ii
whole
lotta
love
opens
the
album
with
a
earth
moving
riff
and
then
guitars
soar
and
come
crashing
down
throughout
the
song
that
is
marked
by
a
glass
shattering
vocal
from
robert
plant
the
song
became
a
big
hit
and
their
only
top
ten
single
peaking
at
number
4
in
early
1970
the
lemon
song
is
a
bluesy
jam
that
finds
mr
plant
scatting
along
with
some
memorable
lyrics
ramble
on
is
perfectly
titled
as
the
song
just
kind
of
scuffles
around
with
a
chooglin
guitar
riff
as
its
backbone
john
bonham
gets
to
show
off
why
they
call
him
bonzo
on
the
drum
workout
moby
dick
thank
you
has
to
rank
as
one
of
the
prettiest
songs
in
rock
and
probably
the
most
tender
number
the
band
has
ever
recorded
mr
plant
provides
an
almost
whisper
like
vocal
that
is
framed
by
ethereal
keyboards
from
john
paul
jones
the
song's
quiet
beauty
merges
into
the
stinging
guitars
of
heartbreaker
which
merges
seamlessly
into
the
rollicking
living
loving
maid
led
zeppelin
ii
became
the
band's
first
number
one
album

sure

it

ii

bad
recording
this
cd
was
very
poorly
recorded
in
fact
it
sounded
more
like
a
bootleg
recording
than
a
remastered
cd
the
volume
is
very
low
and
the
sound
is
muffled

the
cd
