an
excerpt
from
the
eagle
has
landed
the
eagle
has
landed
is
a
revised
story
of
the
moon
landing
told
through
images
composed
entirely
of
paper
models
in
june
of
2010
i
was
awarded
a
residency
at
the
columbia
college
center
for
book
and
paper
arts
my
proposal
stated
that
i
would
use
their
bookmaking
facilities
to
first
make
handmade
paper
dappled
and
cratered
to
look
like
the
surface
of
the
moon
and
then
place
miniature
objects
on
this
lunar
landscape
to
create
photographed
scenarios
these
still
images
would
combine
to
tell
an
alternate
history
to
the
moon
landing
story
we
know
a
subversive
view
of
the
intentions
of
nasa
and
the
us
government
during
the
cold
war
in
the
first
week
of
the
residency
i
produced
raisedrelief
sheets
of
handmade
paper
molded
to
look
like
the
moon’s
surface
and
flat
sheets
of
paper
pigmented
to
portray
distant
views
of
the
full
moon
in
the
second
week
i
began
photographing
the
objects
i
had
a
few
scenarios
in
mind
all
of
which
were
impossibilities
using
technologies
we
know
cannot
function
on
the
moon
the
first
photos
i
shot
were
of
astronauts
using
semiautomatic
rifles
from
this
point
onward
the
story
began
to
develop
and
eventually
became
a
space
western
in
the
story
neil
armstrong
and
buzz
aldrin
go
from
being
carefree
rambunctious
astronauts
playing
king
of
the
mountain
on
moon
rocks
to
being
embroiled
in
a
space
shootout
once
they
realize
that
the
russians
have
secretly
beat
the
americans
to
the
moon
mundane
materials
such
as
paper
pulp
and
tin
foil
combined
with
ricepaperclothed
mattel
spacemen
toys
are
used
as
a
subtext
to
question
the
practicality
and
usefulness
of
our
nation’s
military
aeronautics
history
as
the
us
space
program
nears
its
end
shifting
to
international
group
efforts
and
privatization
this
work
looks
back
at
the
nationalistic
and
military
origins
of
the
program
early
1960’s
fears
of
the
moon
being
used
as
a
military
base
and
the
ultimate
strategic
position
are
invoked
throughout
the
story
through
the
planting
of
flags
the
use
of
semiautomatic
rifles
and
military
funerals
the
work
also
alludes
to
conspiracy
theories
about
the
moon
landing
it
is
after
all
a
model
an
assistant
and
i
created
in
the
span
of
two
weeks
on
a
shoestring
budget
with
one
nice
camera
and
a
good
spotlight
the
work
does
not
attempt
to
be
a
perfect
model
replica
of
the
moon
i
found
this
project
to
be
more
interesting
when
it
depicted
something
closer
to
what
we
imagine
the
moon
to
look
like
the
viewer
is
given
just
enough
information
that
they
immediately
grasp
what
they
are
looking
at
upon
a
slightly
closer
look
though
they
can
see
such
details
as
the
frayed
paper
fibers
in
the
astronaut’s
spacesuits
illuminated
by
the
spotlight
and
the
familiar
crinkle
of
crumpled
tin
foil
in
the
landing
gear
of
the
eagle
there
is
a
sense
of
the
absurd
in
the
execution
of
the
work
in
the
suggestion
that
something
so
commanding
in
its
function
could
be
represented
in
such
a
meager
form
the
work
alludes
to
our
obsession
with
machines
as
something
that
is
ingrained
in
us
at
a
very
young
age
toy
rockets
and
the
dreams
we
may
have
had
for
technology
and
space
travel
as
children
are
invoked
this
project
was
produced
with
the
support
of
columbia
college
the
columbia
college
center
for
book
and
paper
arts
and
the
illinois
