in
their
native
united
kingdom
during
1962–1970
the
beatles
released
12
studio
albums
13
eps
and
22
singles
however
the
band's
international
discography
is
complicated
due
to
different
versions
of
their
albums
sometimes
being
released
in
other
countries
particularly
during
their
early
years
on
capitol
records
in
the
united
states
the
beatles'
discography
was
originally
released
on
the
vinyl
format
with
fulllength
long
plays
(lps)
shorter
eps
and
singles
(sps)
over
the
years
the
collection
has
also
been
released
on
cassette
8track
compact
disc
(cd)
and
on
a
usb
flash
drive
in
mp3
and
24bit
flac
format
although
their
output
has
come
to
include
vault
items
and
remixed
mashups
the
core
beatles
discography
recorded
during
the
1960s
is
217
songs
and
approximately
ten
hours
of
music
most
of
the
beatles'
albums
were
released
in
both
mono
and
stereo
since
mono
record
players
were
the
most
common
at
the
time
the
beatles
and
their
regular
producer
george
martin
gave
more
time
and
attention
to
preparing
mono
mixes
of
their
recordings
the
beatles
had
only
involved
themselves
in
creating
the
mono
mixes
for
the
first
four
albums
the
stereo
mixes
were
prepared
without
their
supervision
however
because
by
the
late
1960s
stereo
record
players
became
more
common
their
final
two
albums—abbey
road
and
let
it
be—were
mixed
and
released
in
stereo
only
from
1968
in
both
the
uk
and
the
us
starting
with
the
single
hey
jude
and
the
album
the
beatles
(better
known
as
the
white
album)
new
releases
appeared
on
the
apple
label
parlophone
and
capitol
catalogue
numbers
continued
to
be
used
for
contractual
reasons
the
beatles'
uk
discography
was
released
on
cd
in
the
late
1980s
according
to
the
official
editions
of
the
first
four
albums
they
were
released
in
mono
the
remaining
albums
were
then
issued
in
stereo
only
however
the
sound
of
the
digital
transfers
of
the
discs
produced
by
george
martin
in
1987
and
1988
using
the
best
equipment
available
during
the
early
days
of
the
format
no
longer
met
the
standards
achievable
of
21st
century
techniques
from
2005
over
a
fouryear
period
the
original
recordings
were
remastered
using
the
latest
technology

of
