jackson
walsh
and
boyens
made
numerous
changes
to
the
story
for
purposes
of
pacing
and
character
development
jackson
said
his
main
desire
was
to
make
a
film
focused
primarily
on
frodo
and
the
ring
the
backbone
of
the
story[19]
the
prologue
condenses
tolkien's
backstory
in
which
the
last
alliance's
seven
year
siege
of
the
baradd&ucircr
is
a
single
battle
where
sauron
is
shown
to
explode
though
tolkien
only
said
his
spirit
flees[20]
events
at
the
beginning
of
the
film
are
condensed
or
omitted
altogether
in
the
book
the
time
between
gandalf
leaving
the
ring
to
frodo
and
returning
to
reveal
its
inscription
which
is
17
years
is
compressed
for
timing
reasons[21]
frodo
also
spends
a
few
months
preparing
to
move
to
buckland
on
the
eastern
border
of
the
shire
this
move
is
omitted
and
combined
with
him
setting
out
for
rivendell
also
compressed
is
the
time
between
frodo
and
sam
leaving
bag
end
and
their
meeting
merry
and
pippin
characters
such
as
tom
bombadil
are
left
out
to
simplify
the
plot
and
increase
the
threat
of
the
ringwraiths
such
sequences
are
left
out
to
make
time
to
introduce
saruman
who
in
the
book
doesn't
appear
until
a
flashback
told
at
the
council
of
elrond
saruman's
role
is
enhanced
he
is
to
blame
for
the
blizzard
on
caradhras
a
role
taken
from
sauron
and/or
caradhras
itself
in
the
book
gandalf's
capture
by
saruman
is
also
expanded
with
a
fight
sequence
the
role
of
barliman
butterbur
at
the
prancing
pony
is
largely
removed
for
time
and
dramatic
flow
the
events
at
weathertop
were
also
altered
the
location
of
the
fight
against
the
ringwraiths
was
changed
to
the
ruins
on
top
of
the
hill
rather
than
a
campsite
at
its
base
when
frodo
was
stabbed
in
the
book
the
party
spent
two
weeks
travelling
to
rivendell
but
in
the
film
this
is
shortened
to
less
than
a
week
with
frodo's
condition
worsening
at
a
commensurately
greater
rate
arwen
was
given
a
greater
role
in
the
film
accompanying
frodo
all
the
way
to
rivendell
while
in
the
book
frodo
faced
the
ringwraiths
alone
at
the
ford
of
bruinen
the
character
of
glorfindel
was
omitted
entirely
and
his
scenes
were
also
given
to
arwen
she
was
tacitly
credited
with
the
river
rising
against
the
ringwraiths
which
was
the
work
of
her
father
elrond
with
aid
from
gandalf
in
the
book
a
significant
new
addition
is
aragorn's
selfdoubt
which
causes
him
to
hesitate
to
claim
the
kingship
of
gondor
this
element
is
not
present
in
the
book
where
aragorn
intends
to
claim
the
throne
at
an
appropriate
time
in
the
book
narsil
is
reforged
immediately
when
he
joins
the
fellowship
but
this
event
is
held
over
until
return
of
the
king
in
film
to
symbolically
coincide
with
his
acceptance
of
his
title
these
elements
were
added
because
peter
jackson
believed
that
each
character
should
be
forced
to
grow
or
change
over
the
course
of
the
story
elrond's
character
gained
an
adversarial
edge
he
expresses
doubts
in
the
strength
of
men
to
resist
sauron's
evil
after
isildur's
failure
to
destroy
the
ring
as
depicted
in
the
prologue
jackson
also
shortens
the
council
of
elrond
by
spreading
its
exposition
into
earlier
parts
of
the
film
elrond's
counsellor
erestor—who
suggested
the
ring
be
given
to
tom
bombadil—was
completely
absent
from
this
scene
gimli's
father
gl&oacutein
was
also
deemed
unnecessary
the
tone
of
the
moria
sequence
was
altered
although
in
the
book
the
fellowship
only
realises
the
dwarves
are
all
dead
once
they
reach
balin's
tomb
the
filmmakers
chose
to
use
foreshadowing
devices
instead
gandalf
says
to
gimli
he
would
prefer
not
to
enter
moria
and
saruman
is
shown
to
be
aware
of
gandalf's
reticence
and
also
reveals
an
illustration
of
the
balrog
in
one
of
his
books
the
corpses
of
the
dwarves
are
instantly
shown
as
the
fellowship
enter
moria[22]
in
terms
of
dramatic
structure
the
book
simply
ends
there
is
no
climax
because
tolkien
wrote
the
trilogy
as
a
single
story
published
in
three
volumes
jackson's
version
incorporates
the
first
chapter
of
'the
two
towers
and
makes
its
events
told
in
real
time
instead
of
flashback
simultaneous
with
the
breaking
of
the
fellowship
this
finale
is
played
as
a
climactic
battle
into
which
he
introduces
the
urukhai
referred
to
as
lurtz
in
the
script
in
the
book
boromir
is
unable
to
tell
aragorn
which
hobbits
were
kidnapped
by
the
orcs
before
he
dies
from
there
aragorn
deduces
frodo's
intentions
when
he
notices
that
a
boat
is
missing
and
sam's
pack
is
gone
in
the
film
aragorn
and
frodo
have
a
scene
together
in
which
frodo's
intentions
are
explicitly
stated
production
jackson
began
working
with
christian
rivers
to
storyboard
the
trilogy
in
august
1997
as
well
as
getting
richard
taylor
and
weta
workshop
to
begin
creating
his
interpretation
of
middleearth[23]
jackson
told
them
to
make
middleearth
as
plausible
and
believable
as
possible
to
think
of
middleearth
in
a
historical
manner[24]
in

illusion
that

scene
involves
setting
a

so
that

characters
are
all
the
correct
height
elijah
wood
who
plays
frodo
is
5&nbspft
6in
(168&nbspm)
tall
in
real
life
but
the
character
of
frodo
baggins
is
barely
four
feet
in
height
many
different
tricks
were
used
to
depict
the
hobbits
(and
gimli
the
dwarf)
as
being
of
diminutive
stature
(in
a
happy
coincidence
johnrhys
davies&nbsp—
who
played
gimli&nbsp—
is
as
tall
compared
to
the
hobbit
actors
as
his
character
needed
to
be
compared
to
theirs
so
he
did
not
need
to
be

as
a
third
variation
of

and
is
quite
taller
than
orlando

doubles
were
used
in

while
entire
duplicates
of
certain
sets
(including

in

were
built
at

that

would

to
be

elijah

was
also
employed
so
that
it
would
look
as
though

hobbits
were
interacting
with
taller
men
and
elves
even
the
simple
use
of
kneeling
down
to
the
filmmakers'
surprise
turned
out
to
be
an
effective
method
in
creating
the
illusion
for
the
battle
between
the
last

and
the
forces
of
sauron
that
begins
the

an
