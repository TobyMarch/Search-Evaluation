great
book
and
great
fun!
many
have
seen
the
movie
but
not
read
the
book
the
book
is
much
better
as
many
readers
can
guess
for
this
is
the
usual
case
the
book
has
more
twists
and
characters
that
are
not
in
the
movie
and
gives
a
better
sense
of
the
time
that
just
was
not
conveyed
in
the
movie
it
is
just
a
fun
book
to
read!

although
not
true
to
the
book
the
movie
had
an
all

cast
if
you

the
price
of
either
is
too
high
then
don't

it

incredible
book
when
i
first
started
this
book
i
got
sick
of
it
fast
i
read
reviews
and
saw
that
it
was
one
of
the
most
exciting
and
action
packed
novels
ever
since
it
was
my
first
time
reading
a
higgins
or
higginsesque
novel
i
wasn't
aware
of
the
background
at
the
introductions
however
after
finally
reading
through
the
introduction
it
turned
out
i
was
wrong
the
book
kicks
off
action
not
that
deep
in
and
doesn't
stop
until
the
last
word
by
far
my
favorite
book
i've
ever
read

historical
thriller
to
make

wonder
this
book
is
an
exciting
historical
thriller
with
charcters
that
you

enjoy
from

a
squad
of
wwii
german
paratroopers
sent

couldn't
put
it
down!
i'm
a
bit
of
a
slow
reader
but
this
book
had
me
completely
glued
to
the
pages
two
days!
this
book
was
simply
awesome
the
beginning
made
me
laugh
with
excitement
and
the
ending
just
made
me
wonder
more
the
book
is
a
flurry
of
action
with
politics
and
a
bit
of
romance
thrown
in
i
enjoyed
how
it
showed
the
human
side
to
the
german
soldiers
and
respected
them
for
more
of
what
they
really
were
instead
of
the
stereotypical
german
soldier
of
world
war
2
that
the
world
has
come
to
accept
the
character
development
was
great
and
may
i
say
that
these
guys
were
all
hardcore
and
the
plot
is
something
to
behold
in
and
of
itself
i
highly
recommend
this
book
to
all
history
lovers
and
look
forward
with
great
enthusiasm
to
buying
the
movie
as
well
read
this
book!
you'll
love
it!!

book

movie
were
excellent
i
read
the
book
back
in
the
late
70's
when
i
was
in
the
us
armyi
was
serving
with
the
10th
special
forces
group
my
unit
was
specifically
trained
for
unconventional
warfare
such
as
the
type
depicted
in
the
book
and
movie
it
was
very
realistic
and
is
probably
one
of
the
best
examples
of
what
the
us
army
'green
berets'
do
for
the
united
states
militarythe
movie
was
quite
true
to
the
book
story

a
great
book
for
anyone
who
likes
historical
fiction
this
book
is
one
of
the
best
books
i
have
ever
read
i
picked
this
book
becuse
of
the
feature
film
'the
eagle
has
landed'
the
book
was
much
better
than
the
movie
and
it
is
a
real
thriller
i
read
many
historical
fiction
books
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
if
you
want
a
book
that
has
romance
action
and
a
very
good
plot
choose
this
one

an
excellent
work
of
historical
fiction
this
book
is
an
excellent
example
if
somewhat
slow
paced
to
begin
of
historical
fiction
from
the
meeting
where
the
plan
was
conceived
by
hitler
to
the
final
confrontation
at
the
end
this
book
is
one
that
takes
you
through
the
typical
stereotype
of
german
soldiers
to
an
excellent
tale
of
german
paratroopers
on
a
mission
to
capture
winston
churchill
the
story
starts
out
slow
and
comes
to
an
exciting
conclusion
that
is
not
to
be
missed
by
anyone
enjoying
other
works
of
jack
higgins
or
the
historical
fiction
genre
