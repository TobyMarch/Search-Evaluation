stone
the
song
for
which
the
band
is
named[6]
critic
and
musicologist
robert
palmer
said
their
endurance
and
relevance
stems
from
being
rooted
in
traditional
verities

rhythmandblues
and
soul
music

to
the
reestablishment
of
their
friendship
and
the
formation
of
a
band
with
dick
taylor
(later
of
pretty

richards

stewart
found
a
practice
space
and
joined
with
jones
to
start
an
rb
band
playing
chicago
blues
besides
stewart
jones
and
jagger
the
first
rehearsal
of
the
asyetunnamed

at
jagger's
behest
also
at
the
first
rehearsal
were
guitarist
geoff
bradford
and
vocalist
brian
knight
both
of
whom
refused
to
join
the
band
citing
objections
to
playing
the
chuck
berry
and
bo
diddley
songs
preferred
by
jagger
and
richards[12]
in
june
1962
the
lineup
was
jagger
jones
richards
stewart
taylor
and
drummer
tony
chapman
according
to
richards
jones
christened
the
band
during
a
phone
call
to
jazz
news
when
asked
for
a
band
name
jones
saw
a
muddy
waters
lp
lying
on
the
floor
of
which
one
of
the
tracks
was
rollin'
stone[13][14][15]
1962–64
on
12
july
1962
the
band
played
their
first
gig
at
the
marquee
club
billed
as
the
rollin'
stones[16]
the
lineup
was
jagger
richards
and
jones
along
with
stewart
on
piano
and
taylor
on
bass
jones
and
stewart
intended
to
play
chicago
blues
but
were
agreeable
to
the
chuck
berry
and
bo
diddley
songs
of
jagger
and
richards[17]
bassist
bill
wyman
joined
in
december
1962
and
drummer
charlie
watts
the
following
january
1963
to
form
the
band's
longstanding
rhythm
section[9][18]
the
rolling
stones'
then
acting
manager
giorgio
gomelsky
secured
a
sunday
afternoon
residency
at
the
crawdaddy
club
which
gomelsky
said
triggered
an
international
renaissance
for
the
blues
along
with
the
arrival
of
the
beatles
gomelsky
marked
the
crawdaddy
shows
as
a
seminal
facet
of
swinging
london's
advent[19]
andrew
loog
oldham
a
former
publicist
of
the
beatles
became
the
band's
manager
but
his
age
of
nineteen

younger
than
any
of
the
band

made
it
impossible
for
him
to
hold
an
agent's
license
consequently
a
partnership
of
necessity
between
oldham
and
veteran
booking
agent
eric
easton
was
formed
when
oldham's
mother
signed
on
behalf
of
her
son[20][21][22][23]
gomelsky
who
had
no
written
agreement
with
the
band
was
not
consulted[24]
oldham
changed
the
spelling
of
the
band
name
from
the
rollin'
stones
to
the
rolling
stones
and
changed
the
spelling
of
richards
last
name
to
richard
because
it
looked
more
pop[25][26]
stewart
did
not
fit
oldham's
mould
according
to
wyman
of
pretty
thin
longhaired
boys
and
was
removed
from
the
lineup
in
may
1963
to
become
road
manager
and
occasional
pianist
for
the
band
until
his
death
in
1985[27][28]
oldham
and
easton
negotiated
with
decca
records

which
had
regretted
and
were
embarrassed
by
passing
on
the
beatles

an
advantageous
recording/production
contract
for
the
rolling
stones
in
which
they
got
three
times
the
typical
royalty
rate
for
a
new
act
full
artistic
control
of
recordings
and
ownership
of
the
recording
masters[29][30]
the
decca
deal
also
let
oldham
use
nondecca
recording
studios
with
regent
sound
studios
a
mono
facility
decorated
by
egg
boxes
on
the
ceiling
for
sound
treatment
becoming
the
preferred
facility[31][32][33]
oldham
who
despite
no
recording
experience
had
made
himself
the
band's
producer
said
at
regent
that
the
sound
leaked
instrument
to
instrument
the
right
way
creating
a
wall
of
noise
conducive
to
the
band[30][34]
the
low
cost
of
using
regent
let
the
band
record
for
extended
periods
instead
of
booking
the
usual
three
hour
blocks
prevalent
at
the
time
a
practice
the
band
continued
to
follow
the
rest
of
their
career
all
tracks
on
the
first
rolling
stones
uk
album
were
recorded
at
regent[35][36]
oldham
presented
the
rolling
stones'
use
of
independent
studios
to
position
his
artists
in
the
music
press
as
more
independent
than
the
beatles
oldham
said
the
beatles'
obligation
to
record
in
emi's
studios
made
them
seem
to
be
mere
mortalssweating
in
the
studio
for
the
man[37]
oldham
promoted
the
rolling
stones
as
the
nasty
opposites
of
the
beatles
by
having
the
band
pose
unsmiling
on
the
cover
of
the
first
uk
album
he
also
encouraged
the
press
to
use
provocative
headlines
such
as
would
you
let
your
daughter
marry
a
rolling
stone?[38]
though
oldham
dressed
the
band
in
identical
suits
the
band
returned
to
wearing
casual
clothes
at
public
appearances[39]
according
to
wyman
our
reputation
and
image
as
the
bad
boys
came
later
completely
accidentally
andrew
never
did
engineer
it
he
simply
exploited
it
exhaustively[40]
a
cover
of
chuck
berry's
come
on
was
the
rolling
stones'
first
single
released
on
7
june
1963
the
rolling
stones
refused
to
play
it
at
live
gigs[41]
and
decca
bought
only
one
ad
to
promote
the
single
with
oldham's
direction
fanclub
members
bought
copies
at
record
shops
polled
by
the
charts[42]
helping
come
on
rise
to
no21
on
the
uk
singles
charts[43]
having
a
charting
single
gave
the
band
entree
to
play
outside
london
starting
with
a
booking
at
the
outlook
club
in
middlesbrough
on
13
july
sharing
the
billing
with
the
hollies[44]
later
in
the
year
oldham
and
easton
arranged
the
band's
first
big
uk
concert
tour
as
a
supporting
act
for
american
stars
including
bo
diddley
little
richard
and
the
everly
brothers
this
autumn
1963
tour
became
a
training
ground
for
the
young
band's
stagecraft[30][45][46]
during
this
tour
the
rolling
stones
recorded
their
second
single
a
lennon–mccartneypenned
number
entitled
i
wanna
be
your
man
it
reached
no12
in
the
uk
charts
their
third
single
buddy
holly's
not
fade
away
itself
based
on
bo
diddley's
eponymous
hit
was
released
in
february
1964
and
reached
no&nbsp3
oldham
saw
little
future
for
an
act
that
lost
significant
songwriting
royalties
by
playing
songs
of
middleaged
blacks
limiting
the
appeal
to
teenage
audiences
at
oldham's
urging
jagger
and
richards
cowrote
songs
the
first
batch
of
which
he
described
as
soppy
and
imitative[47]
because
songwriting
developed
slowly
songs
on
the
band's
first
album
the
rolling
stones
(issued
in
the
us
as
england's
newest
hit
makers)
were
primarily
covers
with
only
one
jagger/richards
original
–
tell
me
(you're
coming
back)
–
and
two
numbers
credited
to
nanker
phelge
the
pen
name
for
songs
written
by
the
entire
group[48]
the
rolling
stones'
first
us
tour
in
june
1964
was
in
bill
wyman's
words
a
disaster
when
we
arrived
we
didn't
have
a
hit
record
[there]
or
anything
going
for
us[49]
when
the
band
appeared
on
dean
martin's
tv
variety
show
the
hollywood
palace
martin
mocked
both
their
hair
and
their
performance[50]
during
the
tour
they
recorded
for
two
days
at
chess
studios
in
chicago
meeting
many
of
their
most
important
influences
including
muddy
waters[51][52]
these
sessions
included
what
would
become
the
rolling
stones'
first
number
1
hit
in
the
uk
their
cover
of
bobby
and
shirley
womack's
it's
all
over
now[53]
the
stones
followed
james
brown

the
famous
flames
in
the
filmed
theatrical
release
of
the
tami
show
which
showcased
american
acts
with
british
invasion
artists
according
to
jagger
in
2003
we
weren't
actually
following
james
brown
because
there
was
considerable
time
between
the
filming
of
each
section
nevertheless
he
was
still
very
annoyed
about
it[54]
on
25
october
the
band
also
appeared
on
the
ed
sullivan
show
because
of
the
initial
pandemonium
the
rolling
stones
caused
sullivan
banned
the
band
from
his
show[55]
though
they
were
booked
for
subsequent
appearances
in
the
years
following[11]
their
second
lp
–
the
usonly

was
released
during
this
tour[56]
like
their
first

it
contained
mainly
cover
tunes
augmented
by
jagger/richards
and
nanker

the
rolling

fifth

a
cover
of

credited
to
nanker
phelge
–
was
released
in
november
1964
and
became
their
second
no1
hit
in
the
uk
–
an
unprecedented
achievement
for
a
blues
number
the
band's
us
distributors
(london

declined
to
release
little
red
rooster
as
a

us
a
level
of
confidence
a
pathway
of
how
to
do
it[60]

was

satisfaction
recorded
in

jagger
richards
and
jones
began
to
be
hounded
by
authorities
over
their
recreational
drug
use
in
early
1967
after
news
of
the
world
ran
a
threepart
feature
entitled
pop
stars
and
drugs
facts
that
will
shock
you
the
series
described
alleged
lsd
parties
hosted
by
the
moody
blues
and
attended
by
top
stars
including
the
who's
pete
townshend
and
cream's
ginger
baker
and
alleged
admissions
of
drug
use
by
leading
pop
musicians
the
first
article
targeted
donovan
(who
was
raided
and
charged
soon
after)
the
second
instalment
(published
on
5
february)
targeted
the
rolling
stones[64]
a
reporter
who
contributed
to
the
story
spent
an
evening
at
the
exclusive
london
club
blaise's
where
a
member
of
the
rolling
stones
allegedly
took
several
benzedrine
tablets
displayed
a
piece
of
hashish
and
invited
his
companions
back
to
his
flat
for
a
smoke
the
article
claimed
that
this
was
mick
jagger
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
case
of
mistaken
identity—the
reporter
had
in
fact
been
eavesdropping
on
brian
jones
on
the
night
the
article
was
published
jagger
appeared
on
the
eamonn
andrews
chat
show
and
announced
that
he
was
filing
a
writ
for
libel
against
the
paper[64]
brian
jones
1965
a
week
later
on
sunday
12
february
sussex
police
tipped
off
by
the
news
of
the
world
who
in
turn
were
tipped
off
by
richards'
chauffeur[65]
raided
a
party
at
keith
richards'
home
redlands
no
arrests
were
made
at
the
time
but
jagger
richards
and
their
friend
robert
fraser
(an
art
dealer)
were
subsequently
charged
with
drugs
offences
richards
said
in
2003
when
we
got
busted
at
redlands
it
suddenly
made
us
realise
that
this
was
a
whole
different
ball
game
and
that
was
when
the
fun
stopped
up
until
then
it
had
been
as
though
london
existed
in
a
beautiful
space
where
you
could
do
anything
you
wanted[66]
on
the
treatment
of
the
man
responsible
for
the
raid
he
later
added
as
i
heard
it
he
never
walked
the
same
again[65]
in
march
while
awaiting
the
consequences
of
the
police
raid
jagger
richards
and
jones
took
a
short
trip
to
morocco
accompanied
by
marianne
faithfull
jones'
girlfriend
anita
pallenberg
and
other
friends
during
this
trip
the
stormy
relations
between
jones
and
pallenberg
deteriorated
to
the
point
that
pallenberg
left
morocco
with
richards[67]
richards
said
later
that
was
the
final
nail
in
the
coffin
with
me
and
brian
he'd
never
forgive
me
for
that
and
i
don't
blame
him
but
hell
shit
happens[68]
richards
and
pallenberg
would
remain
a
couple
for
twelve
years
despite
these
complications
the
rolling
stones
toured
europe
in
march
and
april
1967
the
tour
included
the
band's
first
performances
in
poland
greece
and
italy[69]
on
10
may
1967—the
same
day
jagger
richards
and
fraser
were
arraigned
in
connection
with
the
redlands
charges—brian
jones'
house
was
raided
by
police
and
he
was
arrested
and
charged
with
possession
of
cannabis[9]
three
out
of
five
rolling
stones
now
faced
drug
charges
jagger
and
richards
were
tried
at
the
end
of
june
on
31
july
jagger
was
sentenced
to
three
months'
imprisonment
for
possession
of
four
amphetamine
tablets
richards
was
found
guilty
of
allowing
cannabis
to
be
smoked
on
his
property
and
sentenced
to
one
year
in
prison[70]
both
jagger
and
richards
were
imprisoned
at
that
point
but
were
released
on
bail
the
next
day
pending
appeal[71]
the
times
ran
the
famous
editorial
entitled
who
breaks
a
butterfly
on
a
wheel?
in
which
editor
william
reesmogg
was
strongly
critical
of
the
sentencing
pointing
out
that
jagger
had
been
treated
far
more
harshly
for
a
minor
first
offence
than
any
purely
anonymous
young
man
while
awaiting
the
appeal
hearings
the
band
recorded
a
new
single
we
love
you
as
a
thankyou
for
the
loyalty
shown
by
their
fans
it
began
with
the
sound
of
prison
doors
closing
and
the
accompanying
music
video
included
allusions
to
the
trial
of
oscar
wilde[72]
on
31
july
the
appeals
court
overturned
richards'
conviction
and
jagger's
sentence
was
reduced
to
a
conditional
discharge[73]
brian
jones'
trial
took
place
in
november
1967
in
december
after
appealing
the
original
prison
sentence
jones
was
fined
&pound1000
put
on
three
years'
probation
and
ordered
to
seek
professional
help[74]

satanic
majesties
had
been
recorded
in
difficult
circumstances
while
jagger
richards
and
jones
were
dealing
with
their
court
cases
the
band
parted
ways
with
producer
andrew
oldham
during
the
sessions
the
split
was
amicable
at
least
publicly[75]
but
in
2003
jagger
said
the
reason
andrew
left
was
because
he
thought
that
we
weren't
concentrating
and
that
we
were
being
childish
it
was
not
a
great
moment
really
–
and
i
would
have
thought
it
wasn't
a
great
moment
for
andrew
either
there
were
a
lot
of
distractions
and
you
always
need
someone
to
focus
you
at
that
point
that
was
andrew's
job[9]
satanic
majesties
thus
became
the
first
album
the
rolling
stones
produced
on
their
own
it
was
also
the
first
of
their
albums
released
in
identical
versions
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
its
psychedelic
sound
was
complemented
by
the
cover
art
which
featured
a
3d
photo
by
michael
cooper
who
had
also
photographed
the
cover
of
sgt
pepper
bill
wyman
wrote
and
sang
a
track
on
the
album
in
another
land
which
was
also
released
as
a
single
the
first
on
which
jagger
did
not
sing
lead
vocal[76]
the
band
spent
the
first
few
months
of
1968
working
on
material
for
their
next
album
those
sessions
resulted
in
the
song
jumpin'
jack
flash
released
as
a
single
in
may
the
song
and
the
subsequent
album
beggars
banquet
(uk
number
3
us
5)
an
eclectic
mix
of
country
and
bluesinspired
tunes
marked
the
band's
return
to
their
roots
and
the
beginning
of
their
collaboration
with
producer
jimmy
miller
it
featured
the
lead
single
street
fighting
man
(which
addressed
the
political
upheavals
of
may
1968)
and
the
opening
track
sympathy
for
the
devil
beggars
banquet
was
well
received
at
the
time
of
release
richards
said
there
is
a
change
between
material
on
satanic
majesties
and
beggars
banquet
i'd
grown
sick
to
death
of
the
whole
maharishi
guru
shit
and
the
beads
and
bells
who
knows
where
these
things
come
from
but
i
guess
[the
music]
was
a
reaction
to
what
we'd
done
in
our
time
off
and
also
that
severe
dose
of
reality
a
spell
in
prison
will
certainly
give
you
room
for
thought
i
was
fucking
pissed
with
being
busted
so
it
was
'right
we'll
go
and
strip
this
thing
down'
there's
a
lot
of
anger
in
the
music
from
that
period[77]
richards
started
using
open
tunings
for
rhythm
parts
(often
in
conjunction
with
a
capo)
most
prominently
an
opene
or
opend
tuning
in
1968
beginning
in
1969
he
often
used
5string
openg
tuning
(with
the
lower
6th
string
removed)

brian
jones
was
increasingly
troubled
and
was
only
sporadically
contributing
to
the
band
jagger
said
that
jones
was
not
psychologically
suited
to
this
way
of
life[78]
his
drug
use
had
become
a
hindrance
and
he
was
unable
to
obtain
a

richards
reported
that
in
a
june
meeting
with
jagger
richards
and
watts
at
jones'
house
jones
admitted
that
he
was
unable
to
go

in

(1973)
the
album
spawned
the
worldwide
hit
angie
but
proved
the
first
in
a
string
of
commercially
successful
but
tepidly
received
studio
albums[85]
the
sessions
for
goats
head
soup
led
to
a
number
of
outtakes
most
notably
an
early
version
of
the
popular
ballad

on
a
friend
not
released
until

eight

later
bill

1975
the
making
of
the
record
was
interrupted
by
another
legal
battle
over
drugs
dating
back
to
their
stay
in
france
a
warrant
for
richards'
arrest
had
been
issued
and
the
other
band
members
had
to
return
briefly
to
france
for
questioning[86]
this
along
with
jagger's
convictions
on
drug
charges
(in
1967
and
1970[87])
complicated
the
band's
plans
for
their
pacific
tour
in
early
1973
they
were
denied
permission
to
play
in
japan
and
almost
banned
from
australia
this
was
followed
by
a
european
tour
(bypassing
france)
in
september/october
1973
–
prior
to
which
richards
had
been
arrested
once
more
on
drug
charges
this
time
in
england[88]
the
band
went
to

in
munich
to
record
their
next
album

but
jimmy
miller
who
had
drug
abuse
issues
was
no
longer
producer
instead
jagger
and
richards
assumed
production
duties
and
were
credited
as
the
glimmer
twins
both
the
album
and
the
single
of
the
same
name
were
hits
near
the
end
of
1974
taylor
began
to
lose
patience[89]
the
band's
situation
made
normal
functioning
complicated
with
band
members
living
in
different
countries
and
legal
barriers
restricting
where
they
could
tour
in
addition
drug
use
was
affecting
richards'
creativity
and
productivity
and
taylor
felt
some
of
his
own
creative
contributions
were
going
unrecognised[90]
at
the
end
of
1974
with
a
recording
session
already
booked
in
munich
to
record
another
album
taylor
quit
the
rolling
stones[91]
taylor
said
in
1980
i
was
getting
a
bit
fed
up
i
wanted
to
broaden
my
scope
as
a
guitarist
and
do
something
else
i
wasn't
really
composing
songs
or
writing
at
that
time
i
was
just
beginning
to
write
and
that
influenced
my
decision
there
are
some
people
who
can
just
ride
along
from
crest
to
crest
they
can
ride
along
somebody
else's
success
and
there
are
some
people
for
whom
that's
not
enough
it
really
wasn't
enough
for
me[92]

later
claimed
that
he
had
played
with
the

without
realising
that
they
were
actually
being
auditioned

both
agree
that

yet
richards
and

also
wanted
the
rolling

to
remain
purely
a
british
band
when
ronnie
wood
auditioned
everyone
agreed
that
he
was
the
right
choice[93]
wood
had
already
recorded

played
live
with

and
had
contributed
to
the
recording
and
writing
of
the
track

he
had
earlier
declined
jagger's
offer
to
join
the
stones
because
of
his
ties
to
the

saying
that's
what's
really
important
to
me[94]
rod

went
so
far
as
to
say
he
would
take
bets
it
wouldn't
happen

that
ronnie
wouldn't
join

wood
committed
to
the
rolling
stones
in
1975
for
their
upcoming
tour
of
the
americas
he
officially
joined
the
band
the
following
year
as
the
faces
dissolved
unlike
the
other

members
however
wood
was
a
salaried
employee
and
remained
so
until
wyman's
departure
nearly
two
decades
later
when
wood
finally
became
a
full
member
of
the

the

awaiting

sent
him
a

asking
him
where
he

on

when
richards
and
his
family
flew
in

they
were

after

three

richards
was
charged
with
importing

into

an
offence
that
carried
a

sevenyear
sentence[96]

group
that

had
put
together
to
promote
his
latest
solo
album
and
which
richards
also
joined
this
episode
strengthened
richards'
resolve
to
stop
using
heroin[9]
it
also
contributed
to
the
end
of
his
relationship
with
pallenberg
which
had
become
strained
since
the
death
of
their
third
child
(an
infant
son
named

in

pallenberg
was
unable
to
curb

his
marriage
to

ended
in

although
they
had
long
been
estranged[100]
although
the
rolling
stones
remained
popular
through
the
first
half
of
the
1970s
music
critics
had
grown
increasingly
dismissive
of
the
band's
output
and
record
sales
failed
to
meet
expectations[11]
by
the
late
70s
after
punk
rock
became
influential
many
criticised
the
rolling
stones
as
decadent
ageing
millionaires[9]
and
their
music
as
stagnant
or
irrelevant[101]
this
changed
in
1978
after
the
band
released
some

which
included
the
hit
single
miss

the
country
ballad

and
shattered
in
part
as
a
response
to

many
songs
were
fast
basic

rock

reestablished

the

[158]
it
was

musical
development
the
rolling
stones
are
notable
in
modern
popular
music
for
assimilating
various
musical
genres
into
their
own
collective
sound
throughout
the
band's
career
their
musical
contributions
have
been
marked
by
a
continual
reference
and
reliance
on
musical
styles
including
blues
rhythm
and
blues
country
folk
reggae
dance
and
world
music
exemplified
by
jones'
collaboration
with
the
master
musicians
of
jajouka
as
well
as
traditional
english
styles
that
use
stringed
instrumentation
like
harps
brian
jones
experimented
with
the
use
of
nontraditional
instruments
such
as
the
sitar
and
slide
guitar
in
their
early
days
the
group
started
out
covering
early
rock
'n'
roll
and
blues
songs
and
have
never
stopped
playing
live
or
recording
cover
songs
infusion
of
american
blues
jagger
and
richards
shared
an
admiration
of
jimmy
reed
muddy
waters
and
little
walter
and
their
interest
influenced
brian
jones
of
whom
richards
says
he
was
more
into
tbone
walker
and
jazz
blues
stuff
we'd
turn
him
onto
chuck
berry
and
say
'look
it's
all
the
same
shit
man
and
you
can
do
it'[10]
charlie
watts
a
traditional
jazz
drummer
was
also
introduced
to
the
blues
through
his
association
with
the
pair
keith
and
brian
turned
me
on
to
jimmy
reed
and
people
like
that
i
learned
that
earl
phillips
was
playing
on
those
records
like
a
jazz
drummer
playing
swing
with
a
straight
four[160]
jagger
recalling
when
he
first
heard
the
likes
of
chuck
berry
bo
diddley
muddy
waters
fats
domino
and
other
major
american
rb
artists
said
it
seemed
the
most
real
thing[161]
he
had
heard
up
to
that
point
similarly
keith
richards
describing
the
first
time
he
listened
to
muddy
waters
said
it
was
the
most
powerful
music
[he
had]
ever
heardthe
most
expressive[162]
he
also
stated
when
you
think
of
some
dopey
spotty
seventeen
year
old
from
dartford
who
wants
to
be
muddy
waters
and
there
were
a
lot
of
us
in
a
way
very
pathetic
but
in
another
way
very
heartwarming[163]
early
songwriting
despite
the
rolling
stones'
predilection
for
blues
and
rb
numbers
on
their
early
live
setlists
the
first
original
compositions
by
the
band
reflected
a
more
wideranging
interest
the
first
jagger/richards
single
tell
me
(you're
coming
back)
has
been
described
by
critic
richie
unterberger
as
a
pop
rock
ballad
when
[jagger
and
richards]
began
to
write
songs
they
were
usually
not
derived
from
the
blues
but
were
often
surprisingly
fey
slow
merseytype
pop
numbers[164]
as
tears
go
by
the
ballad
originally
written
for
marianne
faithfull
was
one
of
the
first
songs
written
by
jagger
and
richards
and
also
one
of
many
written
by
the
duo
for
other
artists
jagger
said
of
the
song
it's
a
relatively
mature
song
considering
the
rest
of
the
output
at
the
time
and
we
didn't
think
of
[recording]
it
because
the
rolling
stones
were
a
butch
blues
group[165]
the
rolling
stones
did
later
record
a
version
which
became
a
top
five
hit
in
the
us[166]
on
the
early
experience
richards
said
the
amazing
thing
is
that
although
mick
and
i
thought
these
songs
were
really
puerile
and
kindergartentime
every
one
that
got
put
out
made
a
decent
showing
in
the
charts
that
gave
us
extraordinary
confidence
to
carry
on
because
at
the
beginning
songwriting
was
something
we
were
going
to
do
in
order
to
say
to
andrew
[loog
oldham]
'well
at
least
we
gave
it
a
try'[167]
jagger
said
we
were
very
poporientated
we
didn't
sit
around
listening
to
muddy
waters
we
listened
to
everything
in
some
ways
it's
easy
to
write
to
order
keith
and
i
got
into
the
groove
of
writing
those
kind
of
tunes
they
were
done
in
ten
minutes
i
think
we
thought
it
was
a
bit
of
a
laugh
and
it
turned
out
to
be
something
of
an
apprenticeship
for
us[167]
the
writing
of
the
single
the
last
time
the
rolling
stones'
first
major
single
proved
a
turning
point
richards
called
it
a
bridge
into
thinking
about
writing
for
the
stones
it
gave
us
a
level
of
confidence
a
pathway
of
how
to
do
it[60]
the
song
was
based
on
a
traditional
gospel
song
popularised
by
the
