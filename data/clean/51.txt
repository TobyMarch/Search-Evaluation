i
feel
taken
there
is
no
kinder
way
to
put
that
preparing
to
see
the
prequel
to
some
of
the
most
epic
films
that
have
been
made
i
along
with
most
of
the
world
became
excited
at
the
prospect
of
a
new
chapter
in
the
saga
a
new
chapter
that
promised
to
have
both
the
charm
and
aura
of
the
old
while
incorporating
the
new
technology
of
the
day
however
instead
of
the
addition
of
new
digital
techniques
to
the
epic
story
we
have
the
replacement
thereof
take
for
instance
the
idea
of
a
completely
digital
character
in
the
words
of
ian
malcolm
jeff
goldblum's
character
in
jurassic
park
your
scientists
were
so
concerned
with
whether
they
could
do
it
that
they
didn't
stop
to
think
if
they
should
do
it
granted
jar
jar
buttmonkey
would
have
been
far
less
intrusive
(say
only
as
much
as
a
proctological
exam)
were
he
not
so
abrasive
and
his
voice
less
like
the
experience
of
simultaneously
chewing
aluminum
foil
and
scraping
your
nails
across
a
blackboard
while
a
band
of
dwarven
accordionists
march
in
clockwise
fashion
around
you
playing
an
atonal
interpretational
montage
of
bette
midler's
greatest
hits
as
far
as
the
rest
of
the
story
goes
yes
the
pod
racing
and
the
light
sabre
fight
scenes
are
impressive
but
they
are
not
the
story
they
are
simply
moments
what
we
are
left
with
after
that
is
a
weak
attempt
to
recapture
the
audience
that
iv
v
and
vi
enthralled
on
point
lucas
dialogue
has
always
been
ponderous
at
best
(revisit
some
of
princess
leah's
lines
from
the
originals
if
you
disagree)
in
truth
he
doesn't
fail
to
return
on
that
promise
but
the
lines
do
not
come
off
with
the
same
charm
that
the
first
movies
held
indeed
how
could
they
when
the
lines
themselves
are
delivered
with
twobyfour
accuracy?
i
submit
the
first
scene
between
amidala
and
anakin
in
the
shop
of
the
slavekeeper
the
scene
is
contrived
and
the
dialogue
hollow
the
characters
are
not
talking
to
each
other
they
are
making
speeches
at
one
another
similarly
the
scene
that
should
make
even
the
most
ardent
supporter
of
lucas
nod
a
tired
nod
of
acceptance
that
yes
this
scene
needed
work
i
care
for
you
any
who
have
seen
the
movie
know
the
scene
i
refer
to
and
can
hardly
deny
the
malcontrusion
of
character
and
story
that
forced
that
line
from
anakin
prematurely
in
his
relationship
with
amidala
i
could
go
on
why
try
to
scientifically
explain
the
ability
to
use
the
force
why
demystify
what
had
once
been
referred
to
as
an
ancient
religion?
i
don't
mind
the
allegorical
reference
to
the
christ
story
(anyone
who
could
not
see
the
parallels
in
the
original
movies
was
asleep)
but
i
do
not
need
the
thinly
vieled
reference
to
mitochondria
that
serves
as
the
basis
for
the
most
potent
power
in
the
universe
just
let
it
be
let
it
be
felt
rather
than
explained
my
only
hope
this
film's
only
saving
grace
is
that
it
is
just
a
setup
for
ii
and
iii
however
maybe
i
have
already
seen
ii
and
iii
and
don't
know
it
maybe
if
i
use
the
lucas
plotplanner
2000
i
can
come
up
with
what
is
going
to
happen
in
those
films
before
they
are
released
opening
sinister
scene
showing
ultimate
evildoers
planning

ultimately
