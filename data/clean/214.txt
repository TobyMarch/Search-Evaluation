early
years
formation
roger
waters
and
nick
mason
met
while
they
were
both
studying
architecture
at
the
london
polytechnic
at
regent
street[1]
they
first
played
music
together
in
a
group
formed
by
keith
noble
and
clive
metcalfe
with
noble's
sister
sheilagh
fellow
architecture
student
richard
wright
joined
later
that
year
and
the
group
became
a
sextet
named
sigma&nbsp6
the
first
band
to
include
waters
wright
and
mason[2][nb
1]
the
band
started
performing
during
private
functions
while
rehearsing
in
a
tearoom
in
the
basement
of
the
regent
street
polytechnic
they
performed
songs
by
the
searchers
and
material
written
by
their
manager
and
songwriter
fellow
student
ken
chapman[4]
in
september
1963

moved
into
a
flat
at

stanhope
gardens
near
crouch

london
owned
by
mike
leonard
a
parttime
tutor
at
the
nearby
hornsey
college
of

and

mason
moved
out
after
the
1964
academic
year
and
guitarist
bob
klose
moved
in
during
september
1964[6][nb
3]
sigma&nbsp6
went
through
a
number
of
other
transitory
names
including
the
meggadeaths
the
abdabs
and
the
screaming
abdabs
leonard's
lodgers
and
the
spectrum
five
before
settling
on
the
tea
set[7][nb
4]
in
1964
as
metcalfe
and
noble
left
to
form
their
own
band
syd
barrett
joined
klose
and
waters
at
stanhope
gardens[11]
barrett
moved
to
london
in
1962
to
study
at
the
camberwell
college
of
art[12]
waters
and
barrett
were
childhood
friends
waters
had
often
visited
barrett
and
watched
him
play
guitar
at
barrett's
mother's
house[13]
mason
said
this
about
barrett
in
a
period
when
everyone
was
being
cool
in
a
very
adolescent
selfconscious
way
syd
was
unfashionably
outgoing
my
enduring
memory
of
our
first
encounter
is
the
fact
that
he
bothered
to
come
up
and
introduce
himself
to
me[14]
noble
and
metcalfe
left
the
tea
set
in
late
1963
and
klose
introduced
the
band
to
singer
chris
dennis
a
technician
with
the
royal
air
force[15]
in
december
1964
they
managed
to
secure
their
first
recording
time
at
a
studio
in
west
hampstead
through
one
of
wright's
friends
who
let
them
use
some
down
time
for
free
wright
who
was
taking
a
break
from
his
studies
did
not
participate
in
the
session[16][nb
5]
when
the
raf
assigned
dennis
a
post
in
bahrain
in
early
1965
barrett
became
the
band's
frontman[17][nb
6]
later
that
year
they
became
the
resident
band
at
the
countdown
club
near
kensington
high
street
in
london
where
from
late
night
until
early
morning
they
played
three
sets
of
ninety
minutes
each
during
this
period
spurred
by
the
group's
need
to
extend
their
sets
in
order
to
minimise
song
repetition
came
the
band's
realisation
that
songs
could
be
extended
with
lengthy
solos
wrote
mason[18]
after
pressure
from
his
parents
and
advice
from
his
college
tutors
klose
quit
the
band
in
mid
1965
and
barrett
took
over
on
lead
guitar[19]
the
group
first
referred
to
themselves
as
the
pink
floyd
sound
in
late
1965
barrett
created
the
name
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
when
he
discovered
that
another
band
also
called
the
tea
set
were
to
perform
at
one
of
their
gigs[20]
the
name
is
derived
from
the
given
names
of
two
blues
musicians
whose
piedmont
blues
records
barrett
had
in
his
collection
pink
anderson
and
floyd
council[21]
by
1966
the
group's
repertoire
consisted
mainly
of
rhythm
and
blues
songs
and
they
had
begun
to
receive
paid
bookings
including
one
for
a
performance
at
the
marquee
club
in
march
1966
where
peter
jenner
noticed
them
a
lecturer
at
the
london
school
of
economics
jenner
was
impressed
by
the
sonic
effects
barrett
and
wright
created
and
with
his
business
partner
and
friend
andrew
king
he
became
their
manager[22]
the
pair
had
little
experience
in
the
music
industry
and
used
king's
inherited
money
to
set
up
blackhill
enterprises
purchasing
about
&pound1000
worth
of
new
instruments
and
equipment
for
the
band
it
was
around
this
time
that
jenner
suggested
they
drop
the
sound
part
of
their
band
name
thus
becoming
the
pink
floyd[23][nb
7]
under
jenner
and
king's
guidance
the
group
became
part
of
london's
underground
music
scene
playing
at
venues
including
all
saints
hall
and
the
marquee[25]
while
performing
at
the
countdown
club
the
band
had
experimented
with
long
instrumental
excursions
and
they
began
to
expand
upon
these
with
rudimentary
but
visually
effective
light
shows
projected
by
coloured
slides
and
domestic
lights[26]
jenner
and
king's
social
connections
helped
gain
the
band
prominent
coverage
in
the
financial
times
and
an
article
in
the
sunday
times
which
stated
at
the
launching
of
the
new
magazine
it
the
other
night
a
pop
group
called
the
pink
floyd
played
throbbing
music
while
a
series
of
bizarre
coloured
shapes
flashed
on
a
huge
screen
behind
them&nbsp
apparently
very
psychedelic[27]
in
1966
they
strengthened
their
business
relationship
with
blackhill
enterprises
becoming
equal
partners
with
jenner
and
king
and
the
band
members
each
holding
a
onesixth
share[23]
by
late
1966
their
set
included
fewer
rb
standards
and
more
barrett
originals
many
of
which
would
be
included
on
their
first
album[28]
while
they
had
significantly
increased
the
frequency
of
their
performances
the
band
was
not
widely
accepted
at
the
time
following
a
performance
at
a
catholic
youth
club
the
owner
refused
to
pay
them
claiming
that
their
performance
wasn't
music[29]
when
their
management
filed
suit
in
a
small
claims
court
against
the
owner
of
the
youth
organisation
a
local
magistrate
upheld
the
owner's
decision
however
they
were
much
better
received
at
the
ufo
club
in
london
where
a
small
fan
base
began
to
build
up
around
the
band[30]
barrett's
performances
were

ezrin
based
the
story
on
the
central
figure
of
pink—a

character
inspired
by

childhood
experiences

notable
of
which
was
the
death
of
his

this

pink
would
become
drugaddled

transforming
into
a
megalomaniac

development
inspired
partly
by
the
decline
of

barrett
at

end
of

gilmour
and

became
increasingly
dissatisfied
with

of
contribution
to

gilmour
said
that
wright
hadn't
contributed
anything
of
any
value
whatsoever
to
the
album—he
did
very
very
little
and
that
is
why
he
got
the
boot[154]
according
to
mason
rick's
contribution
was
to
turn
up
and
sit
in
on
the
sessions
without
doing
anything
just
'being
a
producer'[155]

there
were

convinced

[that]
it

there
have

all

of

moments
in

careers
which
they
have
then
rescinded
but
i
think
i
can
fairly
categorically
say
that
there
won't
be
a
tour
or
an

again
that
i
take
part
in
it
isn't

rarely
will
you
find
floyd
dishing
up
catchy
hooks
tunes
short
enough
for
airplay
or
predictable
threechord

progessions
and
never
will
you
find
them
spending

time
on
the
usual
pop
pablum
of
romance

universe

commented
on
pink
floyd's
sonic
reputation
it's
hard
to
see
why
we
were
cast
as
the
first
british
psychedelic
group
we
never
saw
ourselves
that
way&nbsp
we
realised
that
we
were
after
all
only
playing
for
fun&nbsp
tied
to
no
particular
form
of
music
we
could
do
whatever
we
wanted&nbsp
the
emphasis&nbsp
[is]
firmly
on
spontaneity
and
improvisation[247]
waters
gave
a
less
enthusiastic
assessment
of
the
band's
early
sound
there
wasn't
anything
'grand'
about
it
we
were
laughable
we
were
useless
we
couldn't
play
at
all
so
we
had
to
do
something
stupid
and
'experimental'

employed
psychologically
by

the

the

o'neill

explored
the
lyrics
of
pink
floyd
and
declared
the
issue
of
nonbeing
a
common
theme
in
their
music[275][nb

waters
invoked
nonbeing
or
nonexistence
in

with

exploitation
and
oppression
author
patrick
croskery
described
animals
as
a
unique
blend
of
the
powerful
sounds
and
suggestive
themes
of
dark
side
with
the
wall's
portrayal
of
artistic
alienation[286]
he
drew
a
parallel
between
the
album's
political
themes
and
that
of
orwell's
animal
farm[286]
animals
begins
with
a
thought
experiment
which
asks
if
you
didn't
care
what
happened
to
me
and
i
didn't
care
for
you
then
develops
a
beast
fable
based
on
anthropomorphized
characters
using
music
to
reflect
the
individual
states
of
mind
of
each
the
lyrics
ultimately
paint
a
picture
of
dystopia
the
inevitable
result
of
a
world
devoid
of
empathy
and
compassion
answering
the
question
posed
in
the
opening
lines[287]
the
album's
characters
include
the
dogs
representing
fervent
capitalists
the
pigs
symbolizing
political
corruption
and
the
sheep
who
represent
the
exploited[288]
croskery
described
the
sheep
as
being
in
a
state
of
delusion
created
by
a
misleading
cultural
identity
a
false
consciousness[289]
the
dog
in
his
tireless
pursuit
of
selfinterest
and
success
ends
up
depressed
and
alone
with
no
one
to
trust
utterly
lacking
emotional
satisfaction
after
a
life
of
exploitation[290]
waters
used
mary
whitehouse
as
an
example
of
a
pig
being
someone
who
in
his
estimation
used
the
power
of
the
government
to
impose
her
values
on
society[291]
at
the
album's
conclusion
waters
returns
to
empathy
with
the
lyrical
statement
you
know
that
i
care
what
happens
to
you
and
i
know
that
you
care
for
me
too[292]
however
he
also
acknowledges
that
the
pigs
are
a
continuing
threat
and
reveals
that
he
is
a
dog
who
requires
shelter
suggesting
the
need
for
a
balance
between
state
commerce
and
community
versus
an
ongoing
battle
between
them[293]
alienation
war
and
insanity
when
i
say
'i'll
see
you
on
the
dark
side
of
the
moon'&nbspwhat
i
mean
[is]&nbsp
if
you
feel
that
you're
the
only
one&nbsp
that
you
seem
crazy
[because]
you
think
everything
is
crazy
you're
not
alone[294]

quoted
in
harris
2005
o'neill
surber
compared
the
lyrics
of
dark
side's
brain
damage
with
karl
marx's
theory
of
selfalienation
there's
someone
in
my
head
but
it's
not
me[295][nb
64]
the
lyrics
to
wish
you
were
here's
welcome
to
the
machine
suggest
what
marx
called
the
alienation
of
the
thing
the
song's
protagonist
preoccupied
with
material
possessions
to
the
point
that
he
becomes
estranged
from
himself
and
others[295]
allusions
to
the
alienation
of
man's
species
being
can
be
found
in
animals
the
dog
reduced
to
living
instinctively
as
a
nonhuman[296]
the
dogs
become
alienated
from
themselves
to
the
extent
that
they
justify
their
lack
of
integrity
as
a
necessary
and
defensible
position
in
a
cutthroat
world
with
no
room
for
empathy
or
moral
principle
wrote
detmer[297]
alienation
from

waters'

died
in

during

subtitled

the
themes
and
composition
of
the
wall
express
waters'
upbringing
in
an
english
society
depleted
of
men
after
the
second
world
war
a
condition
that
negatively
affected
his
personal
relationships
with
women[300]
waters'
lyrics
to
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
dealt
with
the
pressures
of
modern
life
and
how
those
pressures
can
sometimes
cause
insanity[301]
he
viewed
the
album's
explication
of
mental
illness
as
illuminating
a
universal
condition[302]
however
waters
also
wanted
the
album
to
communicate
positivism
calling
it
an
exhortation&nbsp
to
embrace
the
positive
and
reject
the
negative[303]
reisch
described
the
wall
as
less
about
the
experience
of
madness
than
the
habits
institutions
and
social
structures
that
create
or
cause
madness[304]
the
wall's
protagonist
pink
is
unable
to
deal
with
the
circumstances
of
his
life
and
overcome
by
feelings
of
guilt
slowly
closes
himself
off
from
the
outside

inside
a
barrier
of
his
own
making
after
he
completes
his
estrangement
from

pink
realises
that

takes
a

ride
guided
by
a
goddess
who
shows
him
that
there
are
only
two
paths
in
life
being
which
leads
to
truth
and
nonbeing
which
leads
to
confusion
and
discontent
the

also
told

one[285]
