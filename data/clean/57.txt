it
quickly
became
the
biggest
moneymaking
film
of
all

changed
the
shape
of

after
two
successful
sequels
(1980's

back
and
1983's

that
extended
the

some
time
off

with
mixed
success
in

an
exercise
in

a
film
filled
with
enough
callbacks
to
the

to
remind

episode
i

the
phantom
menace
view
all
star
wars
episode
i
has
become
my
generation's
equivalent
of
highlander
2
the
quickening

it's
the
epitome
of
a
filmmaker
betraying
his
fans
the
base
line
for
terrible
filmmaking
and
the
butt
of
everyone's
jokes
it
has
been
taken
apart
deconstructed
ripped
to
shreds
and
seethed
over
by
countless
disillusioned
fanboys
to
such
an
extent
that
reviewing
it
seems
redundant
what
can
i
say
that
the
likes
of
red
letter
media
have
not
covered
in
far
greater
detail
and
with
much
better
jokes?
being
someone
who
never
likes
conforming
to
popular
opinion
for
its
own
sake
i
went
into
the
phantom
menace
with
as
open
a
mind
as
it
was
possible
to
have
sure
it
might
be
bad

but
surely
not
as
bad
as
its
reputation
would
lead
us
to
believe?
even
as
someone
with
mixed
feelings
towards
the
star
wars
phenomenon
i
wanted
to
be
the
one
defending
the
film
at
least
in
some
small
way
but
despite
my
best
efforts
i
am
forced
to
concede
and
state
the
obvious
the
phantom
menace
is
horrendous
it
is
rare
that
you
come
across
a
film
so
utterly
inept
that
you
don't
know
where
to
begin
in
criticising
it
i
have
neither
the
time
nor
the
patience
to
list
every
last
plot
hole
or
criticise
every
single
creative
choice
(if
the
word
'creative'
is
remotely
appropriate)
nor
do
i
have
such
low
standards
that
i
intend
this
to
become
a
splurge
of
incomprehensible
ranting
about
how
george
lucas
is
the
devil
(he's
not
he's
just
delusional)
so
forgive
me
in
advance
if
this
review
feels
a
little
cluttered
or
disorganised

at
least
it'll
make
more
sense
than
the
phantom
menace
it
probably
makes
sense
to
start
with
the
ways
in
which
episode
i
betrays
the
original
trilogy
and
therefore
the
fans
that
made
lucas
immensely
rich
the
whole
reason
that
the
prequels
exist
other
than
money
is
because
fan
enthusiasm
for
the
originals
was
so
sustained
lucas
had
planned
the
trilogy
several
years
before
the
special
editions
in
light
of
the
success
of
the
dark
horse
comics
and
timothy
zahn's
novelisations
the
difficulty
is
that
the
phantom
menace
doesn't
know
who
its
core
audience
is

indeed
none
of
the
prequels
do
it
doesn't
know
whether
it
wants
to
be
a
direct
throwback
to
the
originals
replicating
the
trilogy's
aesthetic
wartsandall
or
whether
it
wants
to
bring
in
a
new
younger
audience
who
have
no
familiarity
with
the
first
three
films
lucas
never
comes
down
on
one
side
or
the
other
resulting
in
a
film
which
is
too
complicated
for
anyone
older
than
then
but
too
infantile
and
stupid
for
anyone
over
that
age
the
plot
of
the
phantom
menace
is
simultaneously
too
convoluted
and
too
asinine
the
originals
were
classic
flash
gordonstyle
stories
of
good
vs
evil
which
drew
inspiration
from
the
westerns
matinee
idols
and
adventure
comics
of
lucas'
youth
they
explored
ideas
of
freedom
justice
and
redemption
through
epic
dialogue
and
action
scenes
on
a
grand
scale
this
is
a
film
about
taxation
votes
of
no
confidence
and
pod
racing
at
best
it's
not
engaging
at
worst
it's
cataclysmically
dull
perhaps
no
aspect
of
the
phantom
menace
has
gained
greater
notoriety
than
the
concept
of
midichlorians
put
simply
in
a
single
conversation
lucas
changes
the
force
from
a
spiritual
power
into
a
biological
phenomenon
caused
by
something
as
ordinary
as
bacteria
the
force
is
no
longer
something
which
can
be
controlled
and
mastered
by
everyone
given
enough
time
and
training
it
is
something
that
you
can
only
use
if
you
are
genetically
built
a
certain
way
not
only
does
the
concept
not
make
sense
but
it
turns
the
force
into
something
elitist
and
aristocratic
while
the
originals
were
populist
making
us
believe
that
anyone
could
master
the
force
and
become
a
jedi
episode
i
teaches
us
that
jedi
are
born
not
made
so
you
may
as
well
not
bother
trying
to
be
one
or
indeed
care
about
them
everything
written
up
to
this
point
has
been
from
a
fan
perspective
but
even
to
the
casual
viewer
who
may
be
coming
to
star
wars
for
the
very
first
time
there
are
many
problems
with
episode
i
as
a
piece
of
filmmaking
in
general
it's
not
just
that
it's
a
terrible
star
wars
film
or
a
terrible
prequel

it's
a
terrible
film
full
stop
firstly
as
red
letter
media
have
pointed
out
there
is
no
central
protagonist
to
whom
we
can
relate
this
stems
from
the
fact
that
the
whole
of
the
phantom
menace
and
the
other
prequels
are
essentially
backstory
to
get
us
to
the
creation
of
darth
vader
and
the
birth
of
luke
and
leia
skywalker
since
this
transition
would
only
take
up
one
film
at
most
lucas
has
to
keep
us
distracted
for
more
than
five
hours
introducing
characters
whose
only
purpose
is
to
get
us
to
that
point
they
have
no
personality
or
development
outside
of
that

they
just
exist
as
dull
poorlywritten
obvious
devices
quigon
jinn's
purpose
is
to
be
killed
at
the
end
so
that
anakin
can
be
trained
by
obiwan
kenobi
there
is
nothing
else
that
he
does
in
the
film
that
couldn't
have
been
done
by
obiwan
himself
darth
maul
does
nothing
but
follow
the
jedi
and
fight
them
since
his
only
purpose
is
to
provide
a
climactic
action
sequence

which
of
course
ends
with
a
big
anticlimax
anakin
obiwan
and
amidala
are
all
completely
in
situ
they're
only
there
because
they
have
to
be
in
the
next
two
films
as
an
aside
the
body
double
subplot
involving
the
latter
and
keira
knightley
doesn't
work

because
they
look
nothing
alike
why
not
just
create
a
cg
duplicate
of
amidala
like
you
did
with
the
droid
army?
this
brings
us
onto
jar
jar
binks
a
character
who
epitomises
everything
wrong
with
the
film
and
the
prequels
in
general
not
only
is
he
poorly
written
obnoxious
and
annoying
but
he
exists
solely
to
appeal
to
very
young
viewers
patronising
them
with
every
word
he
says
that's
not
to
mention
the
racial
stereotyping
of
the
characters
whose
jamaicanstyle
dreadlocks
and
accent
are
partnered
to
a
personality
which
is
lazy
clumsy
and
cowardly
and
jar
jar
is
not
the
only
blatant
stereotype
on
show
the
viceroy
head
of
the
trade
federation
speaks
with
an
oriental
accent
a
la
fu
manchu
the
performances
in
the
phantom
menace
are
universally
terrible
liam
neeson
spends
the
whole
film
speaking
in
monotone
and
looking
into
middle
distance
like
he
really
doesn't
want
to
be
there
jake
lloyd
is
pretty
poor
as
the
young
anakin
though
he's
mildly
less
annoying
here
than
in
jingle
all
the
way
ewan
mcgregor
does
a
halfdecent
alec
guinness
impression
but
it's
all
on
one
level
and
natalie
portman
looks
mopey
and
confused
not
even
brian
blessed
and
terence
stamp
can
save
this
film
even
if
the
latter
started
shouting
kneel
before
zod!
it
wouldn't
help
if
nothing
else
was
true
about
the
original
trilogy
the
action
sequences
were
always
exciting
and
engaging
but
here
not
even
the
mindless
action
is
remotely
entertaining
lucas
has
become
so
reliant
on
cgi
that
the
battles
have
no
physicality
and
the
lightsaber
fights
are
so
highly
choreographed
that
there
is
no
surprise
or
spontaneity
the
editing
is
repetitive
lucas'
camerawork
is
lazy
and
his
staging
of
every
scene
is
broadly
the
same
with
character
either
sitting
and
talking
or
walking
and
talking
there
is
no
better
example
of
a
pointless
action
sequence
than
the
pod
race
like
so
much
of
the
prequel
trilogy
it
feels
like
we're
watching
someone
playing
a
computer
game

or
that
the
film
is
essentially
a
long
advert
for
said
computer
game
we
sit
there
watching
pods
overtaking
each
other
at
random
enduring
random
explosions
and
changes
in
the
course
until
convention
takes
over
and
anakin
wins
in
many
ways
it
sums
up
the
film
being
a
long
tedious
distraction
with
no
narrative
purpose
designed
only
to
milk
money
from
people
who
are
mostly
too
young
to
know
better
star
wars
episode
i

the
phantom
menace
is
a
cataclysmic
alliance
of
boredom
and
betrayal
that
will
break
the
spirits
of
any
star
wars
fan
and
put
newcomers
off
the
series
for
life
every
aspect
of
the
film
that
you
could
possibly
mention
has
something
wrong
with
it
and
all
the
pieces
are
barely
held
together
by
lucas'
horrible
direction
and
lazy
editing
it's
a
soulless
and
depressing
experience
which
leaves
us
not
just
reeling
from
its
own
awfulness
but
from
the
knowledge
that
there
are
two
more
films
to
go
before
we
get
to
the
good
stuff
still
at
least
things
can't
get
any
worse

right?

the
phantom
menace
is
really
bad
and
not
even
the
cool
lightsaber
battles
can
save
it
we
are
introduced
to
an
annoying
anakin
skywalker
(i'll
try
spinning
that's
a
good
trick)
and
jar
jar
binks
sigh
but
not
only
that
all
the
characters
in
this
film
are
onedemensional
boring
bumbling
idiots
it's
a
disgrace
to
the
originals!
but
hey
if
we
didn't
have
these
prequels
then
we
wouldn't
have
red

media's

why
they
