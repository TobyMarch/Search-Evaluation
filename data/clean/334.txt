erotic

the

of

with
the

are
the
only
chapters
suggestive

nabokov
himself
observes
in
the
novel's
afterword
that
a
few
readers
were
misled
[by
the
opening
of
the
book]into
assuming
this
was
going
to
be
a
lewd

the
rising

of

style
and
interpretation
the
novel
is
a
tragicomedy
narrated
by
humbert
who
riddles
the
narrative
with
word
play
and
his
wry
observations
of
american
culture
his
humor
provides
an
effective
counterpoint
to
the
pathos
of
the
tragic
plot
the
novel's
flamboyant
style
is
characterized
by
double
entendres
multilingual
puns
anagrams
and
coinages
such
as
nymphet
a
word
that
has
since
had
a
life
of
its
own
and
can
be
found
in
most
dictionaries
and
the
lesser
used
faunlet
one
of
the
novel's
characters
vivian
darkbloom
is
an
anagram
of
the
author's
name
several
times
the
narrator
begs
the
reader
to
understand
that
he
is
not
proud
of
his
rape
of
lolita
but
is
filled
with
remorse
at
one
point
he
listens
to
the
sounds
of
children
playing
outdoors
and
is
stricken
with
guilt
at
the
realization
that
he
robbed
lolita
of
her
childhood
when
he
is
reunited
with
the
adult
lolita
he
realizes
that
he
still
loves
her
even
if
she
no
longer
is
the
nymphet
of
his
dreams
some
critics
have
accepted
humbert's
version
of
events
at
face
value
in
1959
novelist
robertson
davies
excused
the
narrator
entirely
writing
that
the
theme
of
lolita
is
not
the
corruption
of
an
innocent
child
by
a
cunning
adult
but
the
exploitation
of
a
weak
adult
by
a
corrupt
child
this
is
no
pretty
theme
but
it
is
one
with
which
social
workers
magistrates
and
psychiatrists
are
familiar[12]
most
writers
however
have
given
less
credit
to
humbert
and
more
to
nabokov's
powers
as
an
ironist
for
richard
rorty
in
his
interpretation
of
lolita
in
contingency
irony
and
solidarity
humbert
is
a
monster
of
incuriosity
nabokov
himself
described
humbert
as
a
vain
and
cruel
wretch
and
a
hateful
person[13]
in
his
essay
on
stalinism
koba
the
dread
martin
amis
proposes
that
lolita
is
an
elaborate
metaphor
for
the
totalitarianism
that
destroyed
the
russia
of
nabokov's
childhood
(though
nabokov
states
in
his
afterword
that
he
[detests]
symbols
and
allegories)
amis
interprets
it
as
a
story
of
tyranny
told
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
tyrant
nabokov
in
all
his
fiction
writes
with
incomparable
penetration
about
delusion
and
coercion
about
cruelty
and
lies
he
says
even
lolita
especially
lolita
is
a
study
in
tyranny
critics
have
further
noted
that
the
novel
gives
very
little
information
about
what
lolita
is
personally
like
that
in
effect
she
has
been
silenced
nomi
tamirghez
writes
not
only
is
lolita's
voice
silenced
her
point
of
view
the
way
she
sees
the
situation
and
feels
about
it
is
rarely
mentioned
and
can
be
only
surmised
by
the
readersince
it
is
humbert
who
tells
the
storythroughout
most
of
the
novel
the
reader
is
absorbed
in
humbert's
feelings[14]
similarly
mica
howe
and
sarah
appleton
aguiar
write
that
the
novel
silences
and
objectifies
lolita[15]
christine
clegg
notes
that
this
is
a
recurring
theme
in
criticism
of
the
novel
in
the
1990s[16]
actor
brian
cox
who
played
humbert
in
a
2009
oneman
monologue
show
based
on
the
novel
stated
that
the
novel
is
not
about
lolita
as
a
flesh
and
blood
entity
it's
lolita
as
a
memory
and
concluded
that
a
stage
monologue
would
be
truer
to
the
book
than
any
film
could
possibly
be[17]
elizabeth
janeway
writing
in
the
new
york
review
of
books
holds
humbert
is
every
man
who
is
driven
by
desire
wanting
his
lolita
so
badly
that
it
never
occurs
to
him
to
consider
her
as
a
human
being
or
as
anything
but
a
dreamfigment
made
flesh[18]
clegg
sees
the
novel's
nondisclosure
of
lolita's
feelings
as
directly
linked
to
the
fact
that
her
real
name
is
dolores
and
(in
the
novel
but
not
the
film)
only
humbert
refers
to
her
as
lolita[19]
humbert
also
states
he
has
effectively
solipsized
lolita
early
in
the
novel[20]

iranian

nafisi
published
the
memoir
reading
lolita
in
tehran
about
a
covert
women's
reading
group
in
an
npr
interview
nafasi
contrasts
the
sorrowful
and
seductive
sides
of
dolores/lolita's
character
she
notes
because
her
name
is
not
lolita
her
real
name
is
dolores
which
as
you
know
in
latin
means
dolour
so
her
real
name
is
associated
with
sorrow
and
with
anguish
and
with
innocence
while
lolita
becomes
a
sort
of
lightheaded
seductive
and
airy
name
the
lolita
of
our
novel
is
both
of
these
at
the
same
time
and
in
our
culture
here
today
we
only
associate
it
with
one
aspect
of
that
little
girl
and
the
crassest
interpretation
of
her
following
nafasi's
comments
the

interviewer

lists
as
embodiments
of
the

of

the
olsen

and
sue
lyons
in
stanley
kubrick's

for
nafisi
the
essence
of
the
novel
is
humbert's
solipsism
and
his
erasure
of
lolita's
independent
identity
she
writes
lolita
was
given
to
us
as
humbert's
creature
[]
to
reinvent
her
humbert
must
take
from
lolita
her
own
real
history
and
replace
it
with
his
own
[]
yet
she
does
have
a
past
despite
humbert's
attempts
to
orphan
lolita
by
robbing
her
of
her
history
that
past
is
still
given
to
us
in
glimpses[23]
one
of
the

early
champions

warned
in

of
the
moral
difficulty
in
interpreting
a
book
with
so
eloquent
and
so
selfdeceived
a
narrator
we
find
ourselves
the
more
shocked
when
we
realize
that
in
the
course
of
reading
the
novel
we
have
come
virtually
to
condone
the
violation
it
presents
[]
we
have
been
seduced
into
conniving
in
the
violation

permitted

five
years

because
of

nabokov
intended

signed

lolita
was
published
in
september
1955
as
a
pair
of
green
paperbacks
swarming
with
typographical
errors[30]
although
the
first
printing
of
5000
copies
sold
out[citation

there
were
no
substantial
reviews
eventually
at
the
very
end
of
1955
graham
greene
in
the
(london)
sunday
times
called
it
one
of
the
three
best
books
of
1955[31]
this
statement
provoked
a
response
from
the
(london)
sunday
express
whose
editor
john
gordon
called
it
the
filthiest
book
i
have
ever
read
and
sheer
unrestrained
pornography[32]
british
customs
officers
were
then
instructed
by
a
panicked
home
office
to
seize
all
copies
entering
the
united
kingdom[citation

in
december
1956
france
followed
suit
and
the
minister
of
the
interior
banned
lolita[33]
(the
ban
lasted
for
two
years)
its
eventual
british
publication
by
weidenfeld

nicolson
caused
a
scandal
that
contributed
to
the
end
of
the
political
career
of
one
of
the
publishers
nigel
nicolson[34]
the
novel
then
appeared
in
danish
and
dutch
translations
(two
editions
of
a
swedish
translation
were
withdrawn
at
the
author's
request)[35][36]
despite
initial
trepidation
there
was
no
official
response
in
the
us
and
the
first
american
edition
was
issued
by
gp
putnam's
sons
in
august
1958
the
book
was
into
a
third
printing
within
days
and
became
the
first
since
gone
with
the
wind
to
sell
100000
copies
in
its
first
three
weeks[37]
the
novel
continues
to
generate
controversy
today
as
modern

has
become
increasingly
aware
of
the
lasting
damage
created
by
child
sexual
abuse
in

an
entire
book
was
published
on
the

classroom
given
that
its

mix
of
narrative
strategies
ornate
allusive
prose
and
troublesome
subject
matter
complicates
its
presentation
to
students[38]
in
this
book
one
author
urges
teachers
to
note
that
lolita's
suffering
is
noted
in
the
book
even
if
the
main
focus
is
on
humbert
many
critics
describe
humbert
as
a
rapist
notably
azar
nafisi
in
her
bestselling
reading
lolita
in
tehran[39]
though
in
a
survey
of
critics
david
larmour
notes
that
other
interpreters
of
the
novel
have
been
reluctant
to
use
that
term[40]
near
the
end
of
the
novel
humbert
accuses
himself
of
rape
â€“
however
after
noting
this
nabokov
biographer
brian
boyd
tries
to
let
humbert
off
the
hook
on
the
grounds
that
dolores
was
not
a
virgin
and
seduced
humbert
in
the
morning
of
their
hotel
stay
although
sex
had
been
suggested
by
humbert
earlier[41]
this
perspective
is
vigorously
disputed
by
peter
rabinowitz
in
his
essay

that

looks
like

to
the
possible
prototypes
of
lewis
carroll
and
charlie
chaplin
mentioned
above
in
allusions
alexander
dolinin
suggests[51]
that
the
prototype
of
lolita
was
11yearold
florence
horner
kidnapped
in
1948
by
50yearold
mechanic
frank
la
salle
who
had
caught
her
stealing
a
fivecent
notebook
la
salle
traveled
with
her
over
various
states
for
21
months
and
is
believed
to
have
raped
her
he
claimed
that
he
was
an
fbi
agent
and
threatened
to
turn
her
in
for
the
theft
and
to
send
her
to
a
place
for
girls
like
you
the
horner
case
was
not
widely
reported
but
dolinin
notes
various
similarities
in
events
and
descriptions
while
nabokov
had
already
used
the
same
basic
ideaâ€”that
of
a
child
molester
and
his
victim
booking
into
a
hotel
as
father
and
daughterâ€”in
his
thenunpublished
1939
work
volshebnik
(Ð²Ð¾Ð»ÑˆÐµÐ±Ð½Ð¸Ðº)
the
horner
case
is
mentioned
explicitly
in
chapter
33
of

had
i
done
to

perhaps
what
frank
lasalle
a
fiftyyearold
mechanic
had
done
to

sally
horner
in

heinz
von
lichberg's
lolita
german
academic
michael
maar's
book
the
two
lolitas[52]
describes
his
recent
discovery
of
a
1916
german
short
story
titled
lolita
whose
middleaged
narrator
describes
travelling
abroad
as
a
student
he
takes
a
room
as
a
lodger
and
instantly
becomes
obsessed
with
the
preteen
girl
(also
named
lolita)
who
lives
in
the
same
house
maar
has
speculated
that
nabokov
may
have
had
cryptomnesia
(a
hidden
memory
of
the
story
that
nabokov
was
unaware
of)
while
he
was
composing
lolita
during
the
1950s
maar
says
that
until
1937
nabokov
lived
in
the
same
section
of
berlin
as
the
author
heinz
von
eschwege
(pen
name
heinz
von
lichberg)
and
was
most
likely
familiar
with
his
work
which
was
widely
available
in
germany
during
nabokov's
time
there[53][54]
the
philadelphia
inquirer
in
the
article
lolita
at
50
did
nabokov
take
literary
liberties?
says
that
according
to
maar
accusations
of
plagiarism
should
not
apply
and
quotes
him
as
saying
literature
has
always
been
a
huge
crucible
in
which
familiar
themes
are
continually
recast
nothing
of
what
we
admire
in
lolita
is
already
to
be
found
in
the
tale
the
former
is
in
no
way
deducible
from
the
latter
see
also
jonathan
lethem
in
harper's
magazine
on
this
story[55]
nabokov
on
lolita
afterword
in
1956
nabokov
wrote
an
afterword
to
lolita
(on
a
book
entitled
lolita)
that
first
appeared
in
the
first
us
edition
and
has
appeared
thereafter[56]
one
of
the
first
things
nabokov
makes
a
point
of
saying
is
that
despite
john
ray
jr's
claim
in
the
foreword
there
is
no
moral
to
the
story[57]
nabokov
adds
that
the
initial
shiver
of
inspiration
for
lolita
was
somehow
prompted
by
a
newspaper
story
about
an
ape
in
the
jardin
des
plantes
who
after
months
of
coaxing
by
a
scientist
produced
the
first
drawing
ever
charcoaled
by
an
animal
this
sketch
showed
the
bars
of
the
poor
creature's
cage[58]
neither
the
article
nor
the
drawing
has
been
recovered
in
response
to
an
american
critic
who
characterized
lolita
as
the
record
of
nabokov's
love
affair
with
the
romantic
novel
nabokov
writes
that
the
substitution
of
'english
language'
for
'romantic
novel'
would
make
this
elegant
formula
more
correct[59]
nabokov
concludes
the
afterword
with
a
reference
to
his
beloved
first
language
which
he
abandoned
as
a
writer
once
he
moved
to
the
united
states
in
1940
my
private
tragedy
which
cannot
and
indeed
should
not
be
anybody's
concern
is
that
i
had
to
abandon
my
natural
idiom
my
untrammeled
rich
and
infinitely
docile
russian
language
for
a
secondrate
brand
of
english[60]
estimation
nabokov
rated
the
book
highly
in
an
interview
for
bbc
television
in
1962
he
said
lolita
is
a
special
favorite
of
mine
it
was
my
most
difficult
bookâ€”the
book
that
treated
of
a
theme
which
was
so
distant
so
remote
from
my
own
emotional
life
that
it
gave
me
a
special
pleasure
to
use
my
combinational
talent
to
make
it
real[61]
over
a
year
later
in
an
interview
for
playboy
he
said
i
shall
never
regret
lolita
she
was
like
the
composition
of
a
beautiful
puzzleâ€”its
composition
and
its
solution
at
the
same
time
since
one
is
a
mirror
view
of
the
other
depending
on
the
way
you
look
of
course
she
completely
eclipsed
my
other
worksâ€”at
least
those
i
wrote
in
english
the
real
life
of
sebastian
knight
bend
sinister
my
short
stories
my
book
of
recollections
but
i
cannot
grudge
her
this
there
is
a
queer
tender
charm
about
that
mythical
nymphet[62]
in
the
same
year
in
an
interview
with
life
nabokov
was
asked
which
of
his
writings
had
most
pleased
him
he
answered
i
would
say
that
of
all
my
books
lolita
has
left
me
with
the
most
pleasurable
afterglowâ€”perhaps
because
it
is
the
purest
of
all
the
most
abstract
and
carefully
contrived
i
am
probably
responsible
for
the
odd
fact
that
people
don't
seem
to
name
their
daughters
lolita
any
more
i
have
heard
of
young
female
poodles
being
given
that
name
since
1956
but
of
no
human
beings[63]
russian
translation
nabokov
translated
lolita
into
russian
the
translation
was
published
by
phaedra
publishers
in
new
york
in
1967
the
translation
includes
a
postscriptum[64]
in
which
nabokov
reconsiders
his
relationship
with
his
native
language
referring
to
the
afterword
to
the
english
edition
nabokov
states
that
only
the
scientific
scrupulousness
led
me
to
preserve
the
last
paragraph
of
the
american
afterword
in
the
russian
text
he
further
explains
that
the
story
of
this
translation
is
the
story
of
a
disappointment
alas
that
'wonderful
russian
language'
which
i
imagined
still
awaits
me
somewhere
which
blooms
like
a
faithful
spring
behind
the
locked
gate
to
which
i
after
so
many
years
still
possess
the
key
turned
out
to
be
nonexistent
and
there
is
nothing
beyond
that
gate
except
for
some
burned
out
stumps
and
hopeless
autumnal
emptiness
and
the
key
in
my
hand
looks
rather
like

his

expanded

the

it
received
mixed
reviews
it
was
delayed
for
more
than
a
year
because
of
its
controversial
subject

and
was
not
released
in

multiple
critics
noted
that
this
film
removed
all
elements
of
dark
comedy
from
the
story
in

charles

wrote
that
it
replaces
the

nabokov's

originally
submitted
for

film
(before
its
extensive
rewrite
by
kubrick
and
harris)
was
published
by
mcgrawhill
in
1974
one
new
element
is
that
quilty's
play
the
hunted
enchanter
staged
at
dolores'
high
school
contains
a
scene
that
is
an
exact
duplicate
of
a
painting
in
the
front
lobby
of
the
hotel
the
enchanted
hunter
at
which
humbert
allows
lolita
to
seduce
him[66]

my

critics
were
surprised
at
how
sensitively
the

was
translated
to
the

the
show
nonetheless
closed
before

predicting

rich
noted
that
the

reading
of
the
character
of
quilty
seemed
to
be
taken
from
the
kubrick
film

of

in

the
german

was
shortened
from
4
hours
to

but
noted
lolita's
death
at
the
conclusion
which
had
been
omitted
from
the
earlier
longer

it
runs
four
hours
and
was
considered
wellstaged
but
musically
monotonous[70]

it
drops
the

of

also
in
2003
a

in

adapted
by
michael
west
it
was
described
by
karina
buckley
(in
the
sunday
times
of
london)
as
playing
more
like
italian
commedia
dell'arte
than
a
dark
drama
about
pedophilia[71]
hiroko
mikami
notes
that
the
initial
sexual
encounter
between
lolita
and
humbert
was
staged
in
a
way
that
left
this
adaptation
particularly
open
to
the
charge
of
placing
the
blame
for
initiating
the
relationship
on
lolita
and
normalizing
child
sexual
abuse
however
mikami
challenged
this
reading
of
the
production[72]
noting
that
the
ultimate
devastation
of
events
on
lolita's
life
is
duly
noted

noted
that

stressed
humbert
as
a
moral

and
madman
rather
than
as
a
suave
seducer
and
that
it
does
nothing
to
suggest
sympathy
on
any
level
of
humbert[75]
smith
also
described
it
as
less
an
opera
in
any
conventional
sense
than
a
multimedia
monodrama
the
composer
described
humbert
as
deeply
seductive
but
deeply
evil
he
expressed
his
desire
to
ignore
the
plot
and
the
novel's
elements
of
parody
and
instead
to
put
the
audience
in
the
mind
of
a
madman
he
regarded
himself
as
duplicating
nabokov's
effect
of
putting
something
on
the
surface
and
undermining
it

effect
for
which
he
thought

was
especially
suited[76]

named
vivian
darkbloom
(slightly
older
and
with
different
hair)
named
after
a
character
in
lolita
(and
also
nabokov's
ada)
tv
fanatic
reviewer
suggests
this
casts
an
eerie
light
on
several
of
the
pairings
of
older
men
and
younger
women
in
the
series
in
particular
ali's
relationship
with
ian[93]
huffington
post
has
described
the
show
as
generally
having
a
strong
lolita
theme
noting
that
the
novel
became
a
plot
point
in
one
major
episode[94]
a
2008
episode
of
the
hbo
drama
in
treatment
makes
numerous
references
to
the
novel
in
the
episode
laura
a
patient
in
psychotherapy
reveals
to
her
therapist
paul
weston
that
she
had
a
sexual
relationship
with
her
father's
friend
when
she
was
14
she
compares
their
first
encounter
to
the
scene
in
the
novel
where
lolita
first
initiates
sex
with
humbert
she
is
at
first
adamant
that
she
seduced
him
but
in
a
later
episode
would
admit
that
she
had
not
actually
wanted
to
have
sex
with
him
wanting
instead
for
him
to
get
me
out
of
that
house
popular
music
about
the
novel
in
the
police
song
don't
stand
so
close
to
me
about
a
schoolgirl's
crush
on
her
teacher
in
the
final
verse
the
teacher
starts
to
shake
and
cough/just
like
that
old
man
in
that
book
by
nabokov
a
direct
reference
to
the
male
lead
protagonist
in
lolita[95]
in
the
title
song
of
her
mainstream
debut
album
one
of
the
boys
katy
perry
says
that
she
studied
lolita
religiously
and
the
covershot
of
the
album
references
lolita's
appearance
in
the
earlier
stanley
kubrick
film
perry
has
admitted
on
multiple
occasions
to
a
fascination
and
identification
with
the
lolita
character
and
concept[96]
however
the
song's
lyrics
connote
a
cautionary
attitude
towards
boys
as
a
consequence
of
reading
the
novel
though
both
marilyn
manson
and
belinda
claimed
the
novel
as
the
inspiration
for
their
music
the
heartshaped
glasses
to
which
both
refer
appeared
originally
in
the
poster
art
of
the
1962
film
adaptation
and
later
on
some
paperback
copies
of
the
novel
marilyn
manson's
song
heartshaped
glasses
(when
the
heart
guides
the
hand)
was
indirectly
inspired
by
both
the
novel
and
the
heartshaped
glasses
worn
by
lolita
in
the
poster
for
stanley
kubrick's
film
in
a
bbc
radio
one
interview
manson
said
he
had
been
reading
the
novel
as
a
consequence
of
now
having
a
much
younger
girlfriend
evan
rachel
wood
she
consequently
showed
up
to
meet
him
one
day
wearing
heartshaped
glasses
(which
she
also
wears
in
the
music
video
of
the
song)[97]
with
more
direct
reference
to
nabokov's
story
mexican
singer
belinda's
2010
song
lolita
says
that
although
nabokov
wrote
of
the
heartshaped
glasses
it
was
actually
lolita
who
invented
them
(the
glasses
appeared
originally
in
the
poster
art
of
kubrick's
film
of
lolita
but
the
same
painting
has
been
on
some
paperback
covers
of
the
book)
belinda's
song
appears
on
her
the
carpe
diem
album
and
has
been
a
theme
song
of
two
mexican
television
series
the
telenovela
camaleones
and
the
soap
opera
ni&ntildeas
mal
(bad
girls)
rolling
stone
has
noted
that
lana
del
rey's
2012
album
born
to
die
has
loads
of
lolita
references[98]
and
it
has
a
bonus
track
entitled
lolita
she
has
herself
described
the
album's
persona
to
a
reviewer
from
the
new
yorker
as
a
combination
of
a
gangster
nancy
sinatra
and
lolita
lost
in
the
hood
their
reviewer
notes
that
her
invocations
of
sinatra
and
lolita
are
entirely
appropriate
to
the
sumptuous
backing
tracks
and
that
the
album's
song
repeatedly
quotes
from
the
novel's
opening
sentence
light
of
my
life
fire
of
my
loins[99]
popular
music
about
the
term
lolita
although
nabokov's
focus
is
mainly
on
humbert's
infatuation
with
lolita
the
name
has
become
synonymous
with
seductive
or
sexually
precocious
or
sexually
responsive
young
girls[100]
multiple
popular
songs
employ
the
name
lolita
for
a
girl
either
infatuated
with
an
older
man
or
being
pursued
by
an
older
man
celine
dion's
lolita
(trop
jeune
pour
aimer)
(meaning
lolita
(too
young
to
love))
was
recorded
in
1987
about
a
young
girl
who
wishes
she
could
be
in
love
with
an
older
man
suzanne
vega's
lolita
from
her
album
nine
objects
of
desire
warns
a
girl
named
lolita
almost
grown
to
get
back
home
rather
than
to
try
beg
for
affection
she
is
not
getting
at
home

of
