it
is
about
four
siblings
lucy
edmund
susan
and
peter
anyway
i
know
you
all
know
this
book
already
since
you
have
seen
the
movie
but
i
think
it
is
better
to
read
the
book
to
know
the
exact
real
story
since
the
movie
was
sort
of
twisted
the
story
and
the
way
cs
lewis
described
things
was
wonderful
he
sure
can
insert
different
kinds
of
imaginations
in
your
head
he
made
my
imagination
soar!
and
when
i
watched
the
movie
i
was
kinda
disappointed
because
it
was
not
as
wonderful
as
what
i
had
imagined
that
was
based
on
the
descriptions
in
the
book
so
read
it
and
you'll
be
able
to
relate
on
what
i
am
telling
you
about
