could
possibly
love

shrek
2
is
rated
pg
for
some
crude
humor
a
brief
substance
reference
and
some
suggestive
content
what
worked
i
took
my
wife
and
young
kids
to
see
this
movie
at
a
recent
screening
and
we
all
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
i'd
say
that
it's
at
least
as
good
as
the
first
shrek
if
not
more
enjoyable
just
like
the
first
film
it
has
a
great
sense
of
humor
and
features
jokes
for
both
children
and
adults
they
also
fixed
my
main
gripe
about
the
first
film
�
they
eliminated
some
of
the
more
risqu�
adult
humor
i
enjoyed
the
movie
a
lot
more
since
i
didn't
have
to
worry
about
my
5
year
old
getting
some
of
the
profanity
and
sex
jokes
that
were
prominent
in
the
original
because
of
this
it
ended
up
being
a
movie
the
whole
family
could
enjoy
shrek
2
also
didn't
have
quite
as
much
gross
out
humor
as
the
first
one
(that
i
never
minded)
so
some
diehard
shrek
fans
may
be
disappointed
but
i
think
this
movie
makes
up
for
that
in
many
other
ways
despite
not
having
as
many
gross
out
jokes
as
the
first
film
it
still
features
the
obligatory
burp
and
fart
jokes
they
also
take
potshots
at
disney
characters
again
like
the
little
mermaid
early
in
the
film
an
ariel
look
alike
is
shown
kissing
shrek
on
the
beach
fiona
promptly
grabs
her
and
throws
her
back
into
the
ocean
among
great
white
sharks
that
devour
her
nice
touch!
there
are
also
tons
of
homages
to
other
movies
including
indiana
jones
and
the
temple
of
doom
alien
et
zorro
mission
impossible
from
here
to
eternity
and
more
there
are
subtle
laughs
spread
through
the
movie
as
well
in
one
scene
the
town
is
being
attack
and
fleeing
citizens
run
screaming
out
of
a
starbucks
right
across
the
street
into
another
starbucks
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
kids
will
miss
but
adults
will
crack
up
at
those
moments
are
through
the
whole
story
your
favorite
characters
from
the
first
film
also
return
of
course
there's
shrek
who
is
just
as
grumpy
as
he
ever
was
it's
good
to
see
that
fiona
hasn't
mellowed
him
she
also
returns
in
her
ogress
form
though
she's
not
as
big
a
player
this
time
around
and
you
have
donkey
again
who
is
his
usual
annoying
self
(in
a
good
way)
many
of
the
secondary
characters
also
return
including
the
gingerbread
man
the
wolf
in
grandma's
clothing
three
blind
mice
pinocchio
and
the
three
little
pigs
they
generate
some
of
the
biggest
laughs
in
the
climax
of
the
film
the
new
characters
in
the
film
are
fantastic
you
have
john
cleese
as
king
harold
and
julie
andrews
as
queen
lillian
while
andrews
is
generally
in
the
background
and
plays
the
straight
man
cleese
is
a
major
character
in
the
film
and
moves
the
plot
along
he's
more
than
a
match
for
shrek
and
he
has
a
hidden
secret
that
it
revealed
towards
the
end
of
the
film
(though
it's
no
challenge
to
guess
it
early
on)
and
though
harold
is
the
bad
guy
through
most
of
the
film
cleese
still
manages
to
make
him
likable
by
the
end
rupert
everett
is
also
appropriately
vain
and
arrogant
as
prince
charming
while
larry
king
has
a
brief
though
hilarious
cameo
as
the
ugly
stepsister
jennifer
saunders
really
delivers
a
fine
performance
as
the
fairy
godmother
she
sings
dances
and
seems
to
revel
in
being
the
villain
if
you
liked
her
in
absolutely
fabulous
you�ll
enjoy
her
in
shrek
2
the
best
of
the
new
characters
is
definitely
antonio
banderas
as
pussinboots
whether
you're
a
cat
lover
or
hater
you'll
get
a
kick
out
of
this
kitty
he
provides
some
of
the
funniest
moments
in
the
film
his
initial
claw
attack
on
shrek
is
great
and
is
made
funnier
by
the
sudden
onset
of
a
nasty
hairball
that
scene
alone
proves
these
guys
really
studied
their
cats
for
the
film
puss'
ultimate
secret
weapon
is
also
quite
amusing
though
i
won't
spoil
it
here
he's
a
great
foil
to
donkey
and
this
ends
up
being
a
great
role
for
banderas
the
animation
is
fantastic
but
i
didn't
see
anything
new
here
that
wasn't
done
in
the
first
film
i
wouldn't
say
any
ground
was
broken
as
far
as
cg
animation
goes
but
it
still
looks
excellent
the
animators
really
get
wonderful
performances
out
of
their
characters
and
the
humans
though
intentionally
cartoony
look
great
shrek
2
ends
up
being
a
fun
film
and
there
are
a
few
twists
and
turns
in
the
plot
that
i
won't
spoil
here
if
you
liked
the
first
film
i
think
you'll
enjoy
this
and
be
sure
to
stay
partway
through
the
credits
to
see
a
revelation
about
donkey
what
didn't
work
i
can't
think
of
anything
in
this
film
that
didn't
really
work
if
i
had
to
mention
anything
i'd
say
i
don't
think
the
song
selection
was
as
cool
as
it
was
in
the
first
film
the
songs
in
shrek
2
are
good
and
they
get
the
job
done
but
they
aren't
nearly
as
memorable
as
the
ones
in
the
original
it's
a
bit
cringeworthy
when
they
start
singing
livin'
la
vida
loca
the
bottom
line
shrek
2
is
a
fun
film
that
the
whole
family
can
enjoy
i
think
the
adults
may
enjoy
it
even
more
than
the
kids
