who
did
it?
edithistorydelete
there
were
three
different
killers
jorge
de
burgos
(feodor
chaliapin
jr)
did
most
of
it
he
poisoned
the
book
which
killed
venantius
berengar
and
malachia
adelmo
killed
himself
over
the
guilt
of
committing
sodomy
malachia
killed
severinus
is
the
name
of
the
rose
based
on
a
book?
edithistorydelete
yes
the
movie
is
based
on
the
1980
novel
il
nome
della
rosa
by
italian
writer/professor
umberto
eco
it
was
translated
as
the
name
of
the
rose
in
1983
what
are
the
main
differences
between
the
book
and
the
film?
edithistorydelete
it
should
be
noted
that
the
novel
is
a
very
complex
and
layered
story
a
murder
mystery
centered
at
a
background
of
political
philosophical
and
theological
events
and
discussions
as
such
the
story
needed
to
be
simplified
greatly
to
accomodate
a
twohour
movie
in
general
the
focus
of
the
movie
is
largely
on
the
medieval
murder
mystery
with
more
suspense
added
and
the
historical
and
philosophical
themes
taking
second
place
the
book
spends
several
chapters
elaborating
upon
the
historical
background
and
politics
of
the
time
basically
for
years
there
has
been
a
struggle
for
power
going
on
between
pope
john
and
emperor
clement
monarch
of
the
holy
roman
empire
leading
to
the
emperor
declaring
the
pope
a
heretic
this
has
also
caused
a
rift
in
the
religious
world
with
the
clergy
torn
between
their
loyalty
to
the
emperor
and
the
holy
roman
church
the
religious
world
itself
had
already
become
a
complex
organisation
of
religious
groups
over
the
years
differences
in
interpretation
of
holy
scriptures
caused
the
church
to
become
divided
into
separate
orders
that
are
often
at
odds
with
each
other
some
orders
such
as
the
dolcinites
have
even
been
considered
criminal
and
heretic
and
were
therefore
eradicated
by
the
inquisition
the
movie
omits
most
of
this
background
merely
referencing
the
dolcinite
heretics
and
acknowledging
the
precarious
status
of
the
franciscan
monks
who
are
opposed
by
the
pope
but
enjoy
protection
of
the
emperor
equally
large
parts
of
the
book
detail
theological
discussions
between
characters
on
a
variety
of
subjects
most
did
not
make
it
into
the
movie
except
for
the
discussion
about
laughter
and
comedy
which
is
central
to
the
climax
of
the
story
in
other
parts
the
movie
omits
or
changes
several
parts
of
the
plot

adso
van
melk
is
a
benedictine
monk
in
the
book
but
a
fransiscan
monk
in
the
movie
malachi
is
called
malachia
in
the
movie

in
the
book
william's
deductive
reasoning
is
showcased
when
he
arrives
at
the
monastery
and
is
able
to
guess
the
name
and
color
of
the
abbot's
horse
from
a
few
isolated
perceptions
in
the
movie
he
derives
the
location
of
the
abbey's
toilet
by
cleverly
piecing
together
some
facts

in
the
beginning
of
the
movie
the
abbot
malachia
and
jorge
are
talking
together
contemplating
whether
they
should
ask
william
for
help
in
solving
adelmo's
death
as
the
book
is
told
entirely
from
adso's
perspective
there
is
no
such
scene
in
the
book

in
the
movie
william
and
adso
are
nearly
killed
by
a
falling
rock
(supposedly
dropped
by
salvatore)
which
does
not
happen
in
the
book
in
the
movie
william
learns
about
adelmo
and
venantius
from
salvatore
in
the
book
this
information
comes
from
interviewing
several
monks
including
berengar
himself
(in
the
movie
they
never
get
to
talk
to
him)
in
the
book
it
is
adso
who
has
several
conversations
with
salvatore
but
these
mostly
concern
his
and
remigio's
heretic
past

in
the
book
william
and
adso
make
several
trips
to
the
library
even
though
they
were
directly
forbidden
by
the
abbot
its
intricate
design
of
interconnected
rooms
with
dead
ends
make
it
a
labyrinth
almost
impossible
to
navigate
so
they
don't
start
making
progress
until
they
construct
a
map
during
one
of
their
trips
adso
pursues
someone
but
he
is
temporarily
poisoned
from
smoke
coming
from
burning
hallucinogenic
leaves
left
by
the
mysterious
person
in
the
movie
they
make
only
two
trips
the
library
has
a
different
layout
rooms
are
interconnected
by
descending
and
ascending
stairways
and
they
use
a
thread
to
navigate
it
is
william
who
nearly
falls
to
his
death
through
a
trapdoor

in
the
book
william
admits
to
having
been
being
an
inquisitor
however
although
there
is
antagonism
between
him
and
bernardo
gui
there
is
no
mention
of
the
story
where
william
was
coerced
by
gui
into
condemning
a
man
likewise
in
the
movie
gui
taunts
william
by
appointing
him
as
fellow
juror
in
the
trial
of
remigio
and
salvatore
which
does
not
happen
in
the
book

the
girl
features
much
more
prominently
in
the
film
compared
to
the
book
in
the
book
adso
doesn't
see
her
until
they
meet
in
the
kitchen
after
the
trial
bernardo
gui
leaves
the
abbey
for
avignon
taking
remigio
salvatore
and
the
girl
as
prisoners
to
their
executions
the
girl
is
only
lamented
by
adso
afterwards
and
never
seen
again
in
the
movie
adso
notices
the
girl
early
in
the
story
when
she
is
among
peasants
scavenging
for
food
and
later
he
visits
her
house
at
the
end
bernardo
gui
executes
both
remigio
and
salvatore
at
the
monastery
but
is
killed
himself
by
the
angry
peasants
before
he
can
kill
the
girl
adso
finally
leaves
with
william
has
a
final
moment
with
her
and
commemorates
her
in
his
last
words

in
the
movie
malachia
is
seen
killing
severinus
and
subsequently
warning
remigio
to
escape
in
the
book
severinus
is
found
dead
and
remigio
is
ransacking
the
infirmary
looking
for
the
book
suggesting
he
was
the
killer
however
william
later
deduces
that
malachi
must
have
taken
the
book
and
then
hid
inside
the
infirmary
after
killing
severinus
thereby
putting
the
blame
on
remigio

in
the
book
adso
has
a
very
strange
and
surreal
dream
during
a
sermon
featuring
many
people
from
the
abbey
as
well
as
many
biblical
characters
he
tells
william
about
it
who
explains
that
adso
has
effectively
dreamt
parts
of
the
cena
cypriani
a
satirical
book
which
he
must
have
read
once
and
recalled
from
memory
william
recalls
how
this
book
was
often
in
the
same
volume
as
aristotle's
poetics
an
even
more
controversial
book
of
which
very
few
copies
remain
this
gives
william
the
defining
clue
that
the
lethal
book
everyone
seems
so
interested
in
is
actually
the
poetics

benno
of
uppsala
one
of
the
monks
who
helps
william
and
adso
in
their
investigation
but
is
also
a
suspect
was
omitted
from
the
movie
as
well
as
nicholas
the
blacksmith
who
creates
a
pair
of
spare
glasses
for
william
when
his
old
pair
is
stolen
alinardo
the
eldest
monk
in
the
abbey
is
also
absent
william
finds
out
that
alinardo
still
holds
a
grudge
against
jorge
for
beating
him
to
the
post
of
librarian
50
years
earlier

in
the
book
william
informs
the
abbot
about
his
suspicions
almost
near
the
end
(in
the
movie
halfway
through)
the
abbot
deducing
who
the
person
responsible
for
the
killings
is
orders
william
to
leave
intending
to
resolve
the
matter
himself
william
ignores
the
abbot
and
enters
the
library
learning
that
jorge
has
already
trapped
the
abbot
inside
a
secret
passage
allowing
him
to
suffocate
jorge
proclaims
the
abbot's
death
the
sixth
victim
as
the
sixth
trumpet
heralding
the
coming
of
the
antichrist
accoring
to
the
book
of
revelations
jorge
tells
how
he
got
to
be
librarian
in
favor
of
alinardo
as
he
managed
to
obtain
many
rare
books
for
the
monastery
with
jorge's
own
planned
suicide
he
intends
to
become
the
seventh
trumpet
upon
which
william
remarks
that
jorge
himself
must
be
the
antichrist
william
and
adso
try
to
stop
jorge
from
eating
the
book
and
during
a
struggle
jorge
throws
a
lamp
down
and
starts
a
fire
when
he
manages
to
throw
the
poetics
in
the
fire
william
pushes
him
angrily
against
a
bookcase
and
the
entire
library
burns
down
presumably
burning
jorge
with
it

spreading
of
the
fire
destroys
the
entire
monastery
during
a
threeday
burn
william
escapes
the
library
emptyhanded
and
is
saddened
to
conclude
that
all
the
time
he
was
searching
for
a
murderer
with
a
plan
while
there
was
none
it
was
simply
a
chain
of
events
he
merely
unraveled
by
coincidence
leading
him
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
order
in
the
universe
in
the
movie
william
has
to
make
a
tedious
choice
as
to
which
books
he
can
save
at
the
end
which
he
takes
home

william
and
adso
leave
the
abbey
as
in
the
movie
returning
to
adso's
hometown
and
saying
their
goodbyes
adso
later
learns
that
william
has
died
during
one
of
the
plague
epidemics
many
years
later
as
an
older
man
he
goes
on
a
voyage
and
makes
a
detour
to
the
old
monastery
he
finds
only
destroyed
and
overgrown
ruins
although
the
library
walls
still
remain
inside
he
finds
pages
and
fragments
of
books
which
he
collects
and
takes
home
although
he
cherishes
these
relics
it
leads
him
to
the
realization
that
they
are
mere
memories
of
things
that
are
now
lost
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
title?
edithistorydelete
in
the
movie
the
'rose'
seems
to
refer
to
the
girl
of
who
adso
has
thought
so
many
times
although
he
doesn't
even
know
her
name
however
in
the
last
chapter
of
the
book
the
elderly
adso
looks
back
on
his
life
and
contemplates
that
all
memories
and
souvenirs
we
cherish
merely
remember
us
of
things
we
have
lost
and
are
no
longer
there
he
illustrates
this
with
a
latin
proverb
stat
rosa
pristina
nomine
nomina
nuda
tenemus
yesterday's
rose
endures
in
its
name
we
hold
but
empty
names
even
though
we
have
the
memory
of
a
rose
it
has
no
meaning
since
the
object
itself
is
gone
he
may
allude
to
the
girl
the
library
and
also
aristotle's
poetics
now
lost
forever
