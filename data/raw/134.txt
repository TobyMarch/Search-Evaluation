did
Mal
get
involved
in
all
the
dream
invasion
stuff
to
begin
with?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.12">How
do
the
never-ending
staircases
work,
and
how
was
Arthur
able
to
use
one
without
Ariadne,
as
the

<li><a

Why

<li><a
href="#.2.1.15">After
he's
shot
and
killed,
they
resuscitate
Fischer
Jr.
Why
couldn't
they
save
Saito
in
the
same
way?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.16">Aren't
you
supposed
to
be
alone
in
limbo?
Why
are
Cobb's
projections
of
his
wife
and
kids
there?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.18">If
the
world
with
crumbling
buildings
is
Cobb's
limbo,
what
is
the
place
he

up

the
top
really
does
keep
spinning

then
why

it

it
earlier

<li><a

is

filled

city?</a></li>

entering
a
new
dream
level,
how
do
the

significance
did
the

&quot;Death

illuminate,
elevate.
Love
ventures
under,
the
rest
all
never&quot;
come
from
in
one
of
the

<li><a

&quot;Non,

is

&quot;Ariadne&quot;?</a></li>















<li><a

were
the

layers
in
order?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.40">If
Cobb
&amp;
Mal
aged
50
years
in

why
were
they
young
again
on

<li><a

do
the
dreamers
fall
asleep
so
fast?</a></li>















<li><a

did
Cobb
and
Mal
enter

<li><a
href="#.2.1.43">Was
the
decaying
city
limbo
or
was
it
Cobb's
dream?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.44">Why
didn't
Arthur
wake
up
from
the
first
kick
when
the
van
drove
off
the
bridge?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.45">How
did
Cobb
and
Saito
manage
to
get
back
to
reality
(in
the
plane)?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.46">What
happens
if
you
die
in
limbo
before
the
sedative
wears
off?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.47">Is
Mal
in
the
window
after
Cobb
wakes
up
from
Yusuf's
sedation
test?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.49">When
Mal
commits
suicide
and
jumps
off
the
ledge,
is
the
room
behind
her
trashed?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.50">What's
the
original
plan
of
the
Inception
mission?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.51">In
the
film,
Cobb
pulled
a
&quot;Mr.
Charles&quot;
on
Fischer
due
to
the
time
constraints.
What
exactly
is
&quot;Mr.
Charles&quot;?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.52">When
Ariadne
finds
Mal
in
the
basement
of
Cobb's
memories,
she
starts
to
tell
Mal
her
name
but
Mal
cuts
her
off:
&quot;I
know
who
you
are.&quot;
How
does
Mal
know
who
Ariadne
is?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.53">What's
happening
in
the
Extraction
mission
at
the
beginning
of
the
film?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.54">Is
Eames
the
Dreamer
for
the
third
level
or
Fischer?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.56">There
are
4
levels
of
dream.
Based
on
Saito's
age
in
the
palace,
it
could
be
about
50
years
has
passed.
(50
years
in
Dream
4
=
2.5
years
in
Dream
3
=
1.5
months
in
Dream
2
=
2.3
days
in
Dream
1
=
3
hrs
in
reality.)
Since
Cobb
supposed
to
wake
up
earlier
and
the
stewardess
shouldn't
be
passing
immigration
forms.
Could
this
mean
that
the
ending
could
be
a
dream?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.57">Why
does
the
police
investigation
regarding
Mal's
case
put
all
the
blame
on
Cobb
and
thinks
that
he
killed
her?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.58">What
is
the
time
frame
for
each
dream
level?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.59">Was
Ariadne
somehow
aware
of
the
numbers
Fischer
would
come
up
with
or
did
she
change
the
hotel's
floor
plan
so
that
491
would
be
below
528?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.61">How
does
one
wake
up
from
limbo?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.63">What
did
Cobb
putting
a
spinning
top
inside
the
safe
mean?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.66">What
is
the
evidence
that
show
the
whole
film
is
a
dream?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.67">What
are
the
evidences
that
show
Reality
exists
during
the
film
and
Cobb
is
in
reality
at
the
end
of
the
film?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.70">What
is
the
music
used
in
the
trailers?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.71">Does
Cobb
ever
wake
up?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.74">Where
was
dream
level
3rd
(the
snow
fort)
filmed?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.75">What
year
does
this
film
take
place?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.76">Are
the
children
the
same
age
in
the
end
scene
as
in
any
prior
memory?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.77">Why
is
Fischer
Jr.
unsuspicious
about
the
appearance
of
Saito,
his
company's
biggest
competitor,
in
Level
2,
when
he
has
been
warned
before
by
&quot;Mr.
Charles&quot;
that
his
subconscious
is
endangered
by
intruders?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.80">If
the
air
hostess
was
clearly
in
on
the
First
Class
setup,
why
did
Cobb
have
to
sneak
the
drug
into
the
drink?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.81">It's
almost
impossible
to
keep
track
of
who's
in
whose
mind
when.
Does
it
matter?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.82">How
did
Cobb
and
Saito
end
up
in
the
same
limbo?
Why
not
each
their
own?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.91">What
is
the
significance
of
the
Penrose
Stairs
in
relation
to
the
structure
and
meaning
of
the
movie?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.94">The
last
kick
we
see
(The
van
falling
off
the
edge)
wakes
everyone
but
Cobb
and
Saito
up
(Who
are
in
limbo)
but
then
they're
all
seen
breathing
in
the
van
for
a
while.
How
did
they
suddenly
get
back
to
the
plane?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.95">How
come
when
the
van
drives
off
the
bridge
in
Level
One,
the
dream
is
in
zero
gravity
in
Level
Two,
but
the
dream
in
Level
Three
has
perfectly
normal
gravity?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.98">How
is
the
dream
machine
brought
to
deeper
dream
levels?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.100">In
order
to
be
woken
up
from
a
dream
you
have
to
be
kicked
from
the
level
above,
so
how
does
Ariadne
kick
herself
out
of
Limbo?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.101">Why
did
Ariadne
go
to
the
levels
above
when
she
killed
herself
while
in
limbo
instead
of
waking
up
completely
like
Cobb
did?</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.103">How
much
time
was
on
the
second
level
when
Saito
was
being
extracted?
It
says
that
it's
different
with
heavy
sedation.</a></li>















<li><a
href="#.2.1.105">Is
it
possible
that
Fischer's
father
did
in
fact
want
him
to
be
his
own
man
and
split
up
the
company,
but
never
got
the
chance
to
tell
him
before
he
died?</a></li>

Although

is

might
infer
that
Mal
and
Cobb
were
engaged

exploration
together

Mal's
death.
After
her
death,
Cobb
was
forced
to
use
his
knowledge
of
dreams
to
become
a
thief.
It
might
also
be
because

As
it
is
in
real
life,
the
dreamer's
dream
can
be
affected
by
things
happening
outside
the
dream.
If
it
gets
cold
while
you're
sleeping,
sometimes
people
dream
of
ice
or
snow.
If
a
person
falls
out
of
bed,
sometimes
they'll
dream
of
skydiving
or
falling
in
their
dream.
So
when
the
van
in
the
dream
level
above
the
hotel
falls
off
the
bridge,
the
equilibrium
of
those
inside
the
van
is
thrown
off,
and
that
feeling
of
falling
carries
over
into
the
dream,
making
it
as
though
there's
no
gravity
in
the
hotel
level
below
the
van.
This
effect
does
not,
however,
seem
to
extend
any
further
than
one
level
in
a
dream
within
a
dream
within
a
dream.
Another
theory
might
be
that
both
Arthur
&amp;
Eames
aren't
affected
equally:
While
Arthur
&amp;
his
dream
world
are
easily
affected
by
the
loss
of
gravity,
Eames
is
much
more
immune
to
such
influences,
or
he's
actually
well
trained
himself
as
he
must
keep
his
environment
as
controlled
as
possible
when
he
f.ex.
needs
to
portray
as
other
persons.
There
seems
to
be
some
effect
of
Yusuf
driving
through
the
barrier
(&amp;
the
loss
of
gravity
in
the
hotel)
inside
Eames'
dream,
however,
when
team's
surprised
by
the
sudden
avalanche.
Eames
suggests
that
the
effect
of
events
is
weakened
when
propagating
through
multiple
dream
levels.
At
level
2,
when
a
vibration
is
felt
in
the
elevator
Saito
asks
Eames
whether
that
was
caused
by
turbulence
on
the
plane,
to
which
Eames
answers
that
&quot;it's
much
closer&quot;,
and
indeed
the
next
scene
shows
the
van
which
is
chased.

The
original
plan
is
to
have
the
floor
of
the
hotel
room
drop
out
from
underneath
the
dreamers
and
thus
provide
the
'kick'
that
wakes
them
up
-
specifically
Eames
who
is
'hosting'
the
dream
in
the
snowy
mountains.
This
is
supposed
to
happen
before
the
van
plows
through
the
barrier
and
off
the
bridge.
However,
the
timing
is
thrown
off
and
now
that
Arthur's
body
is
in
free-fall
in
the
van,
it
translates
into
his
dream
of
the
hotel
-
thus
preventing
the
floor
from
dropping
once
the
explosives
discharge.
He
improvises
a
kick
by
moving
everyone
into
the
lift
and
then
setting
off
an
explosive
to
cause
the
lift
to
start
moving
up
the
shaft
(this
works
much
like
a
rocket
on
a
space
craft).
To
those
in
the
lift,
the
force
of
the
lift
pushing
them
is
equivalent
to
gravity.
Gravity
alone
is
not
enough
to
awaken
the
dreamers,
but
when
the
lift
hits
the
roof
at
the
top
of
the
shaft,
the
sudden
stopping
or
slowing-down
causes
the
dreamers
to
first
be
propelled
upwards,
and
then
fall
back
to
the
floor.
The
result
is
the
same
as
the
inner
ear
only
detects
the
acceleration
due
to
a
force
acting
on
the
body,
much
like
Eames'
demonstration
of
tipping
Arthur's
chair
over
to
wake
him
up.

<p

Limbo
is
an
infinite
dream
place
of
shared
subconsciousness.
It
only
contains
things
you've
built
in
it
or
what
you
intended
there
to
be,
which
could
explain
why
limbo
has
so
few
projections.
When
you're
there
too
long,
the
mind
starts
to
think
its
real.
That's
why
it's
dangerous.
Cobb
said
before:
&quot;Never
recreate
from
your
memory.
Always
imagine
new
places...Dreams
feel
real
while
we're
in
them.
It's
only
when
we
wake
up
that
we
realize
something
was
actually
strange.&quot;
(The
machine
allows
you
to
share
dream
space
with
others,
but
since
only
Cobb
and
Mal
been
to
there,
so
the
place
is
filled
with
things
created
by
both
of
them.
Ariadne
is
new,
so
there's
none
of
her
projections
in
there.)
The
projection
of
his
wife
is
something
he
tells
Mal
at
the
end
that
he's
tried
to
recreate
over
time
(by
storing
memories
of
her
in
his
mind),
so
they
could
still
be
together
in
dreams.
Therefore,
it
could
be
that
she's
actually
an
intentional
creation
of
his,
out
of
love
and
guilt.
Similarly,
Saito
could
have
created
the
guards
which
populate
his
limbo.
Saito
has
spent
many
years
being
a
powerful
businessman
and
would
be
used
to
having
security
of
some
form
or
another
around
him.
Cobb's
children
are
always
on
his
mind,
just
like
Mal,
but
by
the
time
he
is
in
limbo
at
the
beginning/end
he
has
cleared
his
mind
of
Mal,
but
not
his
children.
So
the
momentary
projection
of
Cobb's
children
could
be
that
he
misses
them
so
much
and
wanted
to
see
them
again
since
he
didn't
see
his
kids
one
last
time
before
he
left.

<p

The
decaying
world
was
not
Cobb's
limbo.
It
was
simply
Limbo.
As
stated
earlier
in
the
movie,
limbo
is
&quot;unconstructed
dream
space&quot;.
Think
of
it
as
a
dream-vacuum
where
nothing
exists
and
a
dreamers
grasp
on
reality
can
be
lost.
This
is
why
it
is
so
dangerous
and
feared
by
the
team.
The
reason
it
was
filled
with
Cobb
and
Mal's
city
was
because
Cobb
had
spent
50
years
there.
As
with
other
dream
levels,
each
state
of
dreaming
is
filled
with
projections
and
places
from
each
of
the
current
dreamers
minds.
Having
spent
so
much
time
there,
Cobb
filled
limbo
with
his
dream-memories
of
his
and
Mal's
previous
limbo
city.
After
Mal
dies
in
their
apartment,
Cobb
wakes
up
on
the
beach
once
again.
This
time,
near
a
pagoda-like
palace
where
he
finds
Old
Saito.
The
jump
from
one
place
to
another
can
be
explained
by
a
previous
scene
in
the
movie
where
Cobb
tells
Ariadne
that
often
in
dreams
you
jump
from
one
place
to
another,
not
knowing
how
you
got
there.
Alternatively,
the
jump
can
also
be
explained
by
Cobb
drowning
to
his
death
in
the
first
level
of
dream
thus
ending
up
in
limbo.
The
reason
the
palace
is
here
in
this
part
of
limbo
is
because
Saito
and
Cobb
had
spent
time
there
during
the
audition
Extraction
that
Cobb
and
his
previous
team
did
for
Saito.
Saito
now
occupies
this
palace
in
limbo
where
he
has
been
stuck
for
many
years.

Chronologically,
Saito
entered
limbo
before
Cobb
did.
So
it
makes
sense
that
Saito
should
have
aged
more
than
Cobb.
Another
theory
is
that
Cobb
entered
limbo
twice.
The
first
time
was
with
Ariadne.
They
found
Fischer
and
kicked
him
back
to
Eames'
dream.
Meanwhile
Saito
dies
and
goes
to

Cobb
provokes
Mal

him.
(NOTE

he

methodically.
This

a

he

the
van.)
When
he
dies
in
limbo,
he
wakes
up
in
one
of
(all
of?)
these
levels
and
dies
again,
sending
him
to
limbo
and
washing
up
on
the
shore
near
Saito's
palace.
Saito,
having
been
in
limbo
this
whole
time,
has
aged
decades
while
Cobb
is
just
arriving
to
limbo
for
the
2nd
time.
A
second
perspective
as
to
why
Saito
is
older,
is
that
limbo
is
formed
around
the
&quot;raw
subconscious.&quot;
During
the
helicopter
scene,
Saito
relates
to
Cobb
his
personal
fear
of
becoming
an
old
man
filled
with
regret.
And
this
is
the
form
that
Saito
takes
in
his
limbo.
His
age
does
not
reflect
the
time
in
the
various
levels
of
dreams.
With
this
in
mind,
the
flashbacks
of
Cobb
and
Mal
in
their
old
age
perhaps
did
not
reflect
them
becoming
old
in
limbo,
rather
it
was
real
memories
of
themselves.

<p

We
are
shown
three
totems
in
the
movie:
the
spinning
top,
Arthur's
weighted
die,
and
Ariadne's
detachable
chess
piece.
When
totems
are
explained,
Arthur
refuses
to
let
Ariadne
touch
his
totem,
as
assuring
only
the
owner
knows
the
'proper
feel'
of
the
totem
assures
it
can
never
be
faked
by
another
in
a
dream.
If
they
did
attempt
to
fake
the
totem,
they
could
recreate
only
its
appearance,
and
it
would
not
'feel'
right.
We
are
shown
this
ability
to
perceive
mistakes
when
Saito
knew
the
carpet
on
his
apartment
floor
was
not
recreated
correctly
in
the
opening
scene.
Given
this
explanation,
how
long
the
top
spins
is
not
a
good
totem,
since
it
is
something
someone
else
can
easily
see
and
thus
recreate.
Paradoxically,
the
author
chooses
the
spinning
top
for
our
benefit,
as
it
is
the
only
totem
the
audience
can
evaluate.
Adding
suspicion
to
the
totem,
Cobb
admits
to
acquiring
it
from
Mal.
We
are
shown
later
that
the
spinning
top
is
a
significant
part
of
Cobb
and
Mal's
limbo,
and
thus
it's
possible
that
Cobb
acquired
it
from
Mal
during
their
limbo
dream,
and
thus
he
never
had
any
real-world
totem
at
all.
These
facts
considered
together
point
to
the
possibility
that
the
spinning
top
is
not
a
trustworthy
totem
at
any
point
in
the
movie.<br
/><br
/>Assuming
for
a
moment
that
Cobb
is
still
in
the
dream
when
the
movie
ends,
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
he
was
in
a
dream
for
the
entire
film.
The
Cobb
we
see
at
the
end
could
in
fact
be
a
man
still
trapped
in
the
final
limbo.
The
last
time
Cobb's
top
falls
over
occurs
early
in
the
movie
when
he
visits
Mumbasa,
implying
to
the
audience
that
he
is
not
in
a
dream
at
that
point.
However,
the
movie
never
shows
us
how
he
gets
out
of
the
final
limbo,
he
simply
seems
to
wake
up
on
the
airplane
with
Saito.
Our
understanding
is
that
escaping
limbo
should
be
very
difficult.
Yet
when
they
wake
up
on
the
plane,
Saito
does
move
as
if
he's
reaching
for
a
gun
which
could
be
meant
to
suggest
they
killed
themselves
to
escape
and
that
they
have
really
escaped
the
dream.<br
/><br
/>A
second
theory
is
that
the
entire
movie
could
be
a
dream.
If
Cobb
did
acquire
the
totem
from
Mal
during
their
limbo
(or
alternately,
if
the
flaw
in
using
the
spinning
top
as
a
totem
is
a
character
mistake
and
not
a
device
for
the
audience),
then
he
also
has
no
way
to
judge
whether
he
is
in
a
dream
or
not.
Mal
may
have
been
right
in
believing
they
were
still
in
a
dream.
In
this
case,
it
may
have
fallen
over
because
it
is
Cobb's
own
dream
and
he
wishes
to
believe
it
is
reality
and
thus
makes
it
so.
Alternately,
the
Mal
that
killed
herself
may
not
have
been
Mal
at
all,
but
a
projection
attempting
to
help
Cobb
realize
he
needed
to
wake
up.
In
this
latter
case,
'inception'
never
occurred
at
all,
tying
into
the
common
belief
that
it
is
not
possible.<br
/><br
/>A
third
theory
is
that
through
the
spinning
top
in
the
end
sequence,
Nolan
is
showing
the
idea
-
'incepting
it'
in
our
consciousness,
if
you
will
-
that
the
whole
of
what
we
think
of
'reality'
is
in
fact
a
dream.
This
spiritual
idea
was
shared
by
Plato
in
his
allegory
of
The
Cave,
and
is
shared
by
some
Hindu
and
Buddhist
traditions.
The
terms
Nolan
uses
in
the
film
suggest
he
is
drawing
strongly
on
the
metaphysics
given
in
'A
Course
in
Miracles'.
This
modern-day
channeled
text
-
purportedly
from
Jesus
-
has
heavily
influenced
many
current
spiritual
teachers,
and
counts
Oprah
Winfrey,
Deepak
Chopra
and
Louise
Hay
amongst
its
fans.
It
suggests
that
we
live
in
a
dream
reality
peopled
by
projections
of
our
own
unconscious
guilt,
and
have
buried
deep
within
our
minds
the
truth
that
we
are
innocent,
&amp;
only
dreaming
a
dream
of
guilt,
separation
and
fear.
The
key
to
escaping
this
mental
prison,
says
'A
Course
in
Miracles',
is
forgiveness
(just
as
Ariadne
tells
Cobb).
It
describes
the
dream
as
being
regularly
penetrated
by
'an
ancient
melody'
of
forgiveness
and
innocence
as
we
dimly
remember
'Home';
a
metaphor
that
Nolan
apparently
alludes
to
in
Inception
through
the
wake-up
song
'Je
ne
regrette
rien'
(No
Regrets).<br
/><br
/>Still,
the
totem
*is*
flawed
in
that
someone
could
recreate
a
look-alike
top
and
only
Mal
(deceased)
would
know
all
the
nuances
of
it
and
correct
weight
in
specific
parts
to
determine
a
real
from
a
fake
(and
hence
dream
from
reality).
I
suppose
Cobb
could
have
since
learned
the
weight
of
it,
however;
Arthur
doesn't
let
Ariadne
touch
his
totem
for
just
that
reason.

Limbo
is
a
shared
environment
not
limited
to
a
single
subconscious.
It
is
referred
to
earlier
in
the
film
as
&quot;unconstructed
dream
space&quot;.
It
is
filled
with
Cobb's
decaying
city
because
he
is
the
only
one
in
the
group
who
has
experienced
limbo
before.
Had
Cobb
not

50
years
there,
it
would
have
supposedly
been
empty

A
second
theory
is
the

is
the
remains
of
what
Cobb

Mal
had
created.
When
Sato
died
from

he

the

in
which
Cobb

Some
say
that

not
Limbo,
and
that
it
is
Cobb's
dream
(for
how
can
Cobb
and
Ariadne
purposely
put
themselves
in
Limbo).
A
point
to
refute
this
is
that
Fischer
was
in

maybe
he
was
just
a
projection.
Mal

a

Fischer?

Cobb
says
at
one
point
that
remembering
what
happened
in
a
dream
takes
years
of
experience.
It
can
be
assumed
that
this
also
works
conversely:
remembering
what
happened
in
reality
when
entering
a
dream.
It
is
made
apparent
throughout
the
film
that
the
dreamers
are
fully
aware
of
what
they're
doing
because
they've
trained
ahead
of
time.
Many
of
the
&quot;why&quot;s
in
the
film
can
be
explained
simply
because
the
dreamers
are
professionals
and
have
training
&amp;
experience.
Imagine,
if
you
will,
that
you
could
predict
what
dream
you
were
going
to
have
tonight
and
you
could
prepare
for
it,
when
you
arrived
in
the
dream
you
would
be
aware
what
it
was
because
you
have
prepared
yourself
for
it.
Throughout
the
film
Cobb's
team
prepares
thoroughly
for
the
Inception
job;
they
study
Ariadne's
models
(with
the
exception
of
Cobb),
they
go
through
the
scenarios,
etc.
By
the
time
they
are
actually
ready
to
enter
the
dreams,
they
have
fully
prepared
their
minds
for
what
they're
about
to
experience
and
their
minds
can
thus
recognize
the
reality
that
they
are
in
a
dream
while
Fischer,
on
the
other
hand,
has
not
had
any
prior
knowledge
of
this
and
can
thus
be
fooled
by
the
illusion.

1956
by
Charles
Dumont
and
Michel
Vaucaire
and
recorded
by
Piaf
in
1960.
It
appears
in
her
biography
film
<i><a
href="/title/tt0450188/">La
m&ocirc;me</a></i>
(2007)
(retitled
<i>La
Vie
en
Rose</i>
for
English-language
release)
and
its
title
translates
into
English
as
&quot;No,
I
regret
nothing.&quot;
In
<i>Inception</i>,
&quot;Non,
Je
Ne
Regrette
Rien&quot;
is
used
to
signal
the
various
characters
that
it
is
time
to
wake
up
and/or
&quot;kick
up&quot;
into
a
higher
dream
level.
It's
an
appropriate
song
for
<i>Inception</i>
because
of
the
theme
of
regret
that
weaves
through
the
film.
According
to
the
<a
href="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/07/17/whats-the-french-song-in-inception/">Wall
Street
Journal</a>,
Christopher
Nolan,
the
writer
and
director
of
<i>Inception</i>,
had
incorporated
the
use
of
this
song
into
the
script
from
early
on.
<a
href="/name/nm0182839/">Marion
Cotillard</a>,
who
plays
Mal,
also
portrayed
Piaf
in
<i>La
Vie
en
Rose</i>
(and
won
an
Academy
Award
for
it),
which
caused
Nolan
to
seriously
consider
taking
the
song
out
before
convinced
by
Hans
Zimmer
to
keep
it.
The
melody
of
&quot;Non,
Je
Ne
Regrette
Rien&quot;
is
also
<a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVkQ0C4qDvM">echoed
in
the
score</a>
of
<i>Inception</i>
by
being
slowed
down.

Although
no
one
can
prove
it
one
way
or
another,
unless
that
person
is
Chris
Nolan,
it
is
hard
to
say.
Both
theories
are
possible.<br
/><br
/><b>Evidence
to
Reality</b>:
If
we
accept
that
the
entire
movie
is
not
a
dream,
and
that
Cobb
did
in
fact
escape
his
limbo
with
Mal,
then
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
he
also
escaped
his
limbo
with
Saito.
Also,
there
are
simple
explanations
as
to
why
when
he
sees
his
kids
again
they
look
much
like
they
did
in
his
dream.
For
example,
he
never
saw
his
kids
faces
so
we
cannot
easily
tell
if
they
had
aged
much
from
his
memory.
In
addition,
the
movie
never
defines
the
amount
of
time
that
has
passed
since
Mal
had
died
and
Cobb
was
banned
from
the
U.S.
So
the
memory
of
his
kids
may
only
be
a
few
months
old,
therefore
it
is
very
possible
his
kids
look
pretty
much
the
same
in
the
memories
and
in
the
present.
In
addition,
the
visual
duration
of
the
top
spinning
is
never
a
trustworthy
totem
at
all,
since
it
is
a
property
of
the
totem
others
can
observe
and
recreate.
If
the
top
is
to
be
trustworthy
at
all,
it
is
Cobb's
knowledge
of
how
it
feels
to
spin
it
that
convinces
him
he
is
awake,
not
the
duration
of
the
spinning,
which
we
can
presume
will
end
eventually
in
the
final
scene.
Visually,
there
is
an
obvious
difference
between
the
wobbly
spinning
in
the
end-scene
and
the
absolutely
perfect
spin
in
the
safe
during
limbo,
again
implying
the
possibility
that
the
final
spin
could
be
natural
(though
only
the
feel
in
Cobb's
fingers
would
know
for
sure).
It
is
alleged
that
at
the
end
of
the
film
Cobb's
children
are
wearing
different,
albeit
similar
clothing
compared
to
the
clothes
they
wear
in
Cobb's
subconscious.
In
the
opening
scene
dream,
you
get
a
glimpse
of
Cobb's
hand.
He's
wearing
his
wedding
ring.
Now,
if
you
follow
the
rest
of
the
movie
keeping
an
eye
out
for
this
you
will
notice
that
he
only
has
the
ring
on
when
he's
allegedly
in
a
dream.
At
the
end
of
the
movie
he
isn't
wearing
the
ring.
If
the
ring
only
appears
when
he's
in
a
dream
and
he's
not
wearing
at
the
end
of
the
film,
that
could
be
confirmation
that
in
fact
he
woke
up.<br
/><br
/><b>Evidence
to
Dream</b>:
It
is
possible
that
the
entire
movie
is
a
dream,
and
that
Cobb
never
left
his
own
limbo.
The
children
appear
the
same
age
as
in
a
previous
memory,
and
in
fact,
appear
to
have
the
same
motions
and
same
clothes
in
the
yard
before
turning
around.
It
suggests
to
the
viewer
that
this
is
exactly
the
same
as
his
memory,
and
thus
he
could
be
still
dreaming.
How
long
the
top
spins
is
not
a
good
totem,
except
in
that
it
spinning
forever
is
only
possible
in
the
dream
world.
A
short-duration
spin
is
a
visual
property
that
someone
could
easily
recreate
in
a
dream.
If
we
trust
the
spinning
top,
it
must
be
the
exact
feel
in
Cobb's
fingers
as
he
spins
it
that
convinces
him
it
is
genuine.
However,
Cobb
admits
that
the
totem
was
originally
Mal's
totem,
suggesting
that
he
adopted
it
as
his
totem
during
limbo,
making
it
impossible
for
him
to
know
the
true
feel.
In
addition,
a
totem
can
not
prove
that
you've
woken
up
from
your
own
dream,
since
you
know
it's
true
'feel'
and
thus
your
subconscious
can
recreate
it
properly.[/spoiler]<br
/><br
/>Also:
This
may
be
a
continutity
error,
but
when
Arthur
comes
to
get
Cobb
in
Tokyo,
they
leave
the
hotel
room
and
go
to
the
roof
for
the
helicopter
at
night.
When
they're
on
the
roof,
it's
day.<br
/><br
/>&quot;<b>Both
theories
are
true&quot;
theory</b>:
Movie
has
two
main
themes:
the
first
one
is
that
the
line
between
dreams
and
reality
can
be
imperceptible
from
the
perspective
of
an
individual;
the
second
that
an
idea
can
be
a
parasite
which,
once
incepted,
can
take
over
one's
psyche.
The
ending
simply
reflects
the
fact
that
the
idea
that
killed
Mal
has
now
taken
over
Cobb;
he
cannot
discern
whether
he
is
now
living
in
a
dream
or
a
reality,
and
we,
the
audience,
witness
that
intimately.
The
gyro
in
the
end
falters,
but
we
do
not
see
whether
it
stops
or
not.
Have
we
witnessed
it
stop,
the
movie
would
be
essentially
telling
us
&quot;fear
not,
this
is
real
and
a
happy
end&quot;.
Had
the
shot
ended
with
it
spinning,
the
movie
would
affirm
the
other
theory.
However,
the
shot
as-is
wants
to
ensure
us
that
we
do
not
know
and
we
cannot
know,
because
Cobb
doesn't
know
anymore.
The
lack
of
definite
answer
IS
the
answer;
for
the
rest
of
his
life
Cobb
will
wonder
whether
everything
around
him
is
real,
and
the
audience
is
deliberately
left
with
that
same
question
hanging
in
their
heads.
Notice
that
when
Cobb
is
in
his
&quot;Memory
bank&quot;
with
Ariadne,
Cobb
is
looking
out
the
window
at
his
kids,
he
tells
Ariadne
that
his
greatest
regret
is
not
being
able
to
alter
this
moment
and
see
his
children's
beautiful
faces
again.
That
would
imply
that
was
Cobb's
inception
to
himself.
He
finally
did
what
he
could
never
do
before
and
altered
the
moment
in
which
he
saw
his
children
and
he
sees
their
faces.
Also,
why
was
Miles
there?
He
was
living
in
France
yet
was
waiting
at
the
airport
in
the
States
(reason
why
MIles
was
there:
When
Cobb
visitied
Miles
it
was
to
give
him
a
gift
for
his
children.
i.e.
Miles
was
traveling
to
see
Cobb's
children
in
the
near
future,
and
obviously
Cobb
could
and
would
have
made
arrangements
with
Miles
when
he
knew
he
was
coming
back
to
America).
Even
more
confusing,
Miles'
wife,
Mal's
mother
was
taking
care
of
Cobb's
children
in
America
yet
we
never
see
her
at
the
house
at
the
end
.
The
inception
itself
could
be
altering
his
biggest
regrets
which
spreads
to
every
aspect
of
his
life
he
winds
up
needing
to
alter.
Or
Mal
was
right
the
whole
time
and
he
was
actually
still
down
one
dream
level
and
Mal
is
alive
in
reality
and
Cobb
wasn't
waking
up.<br
/><br
/><b>The
Spiritual
/
Metaphysical
explanation</b>:
From
a
spiritual
perspective
there
is
a
different
reading
again.
This
movie
is
one
with
a
profound
spiritual
idea
at
its
heart,
for
those
interested
-
just
as
with
'The
Matrix',
and
Guy
Ritchie's
'Revolver'.
In
'Inception',
Nolan
seems
to
be
using
the
metaphysics
given
in
'A
Course
In
Miracles',
a
seminal
spiritual
text
from
the
1970s
that
was
purportedly
channelled
from
Jesus
and
which
continues
to
profoundly
influence
modern
spiritual
thinking.
In
ACIM
the
key
idea
is
that
what
we
think
of
as
reality
is
in
fact
a
dream
-
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
dreams
we
see
at
night,
and
what
we
see
with
our
eyes
open.
Both
are
projections
of
our
mind,
which
is
trying
to
escape
a
core
guilt
by
projecting
guilt
outside
of
itself
onto
projected
'dream
figures'.
[spoiler](For
more
on
this
see
the
FAQ
titled
'If
the
spinning
top
really
did
keep
spinning
at
the
end...').
Thus,
although
Cobb
returned
to
'reality',
Nolan
seems
to
be
making
the
point
that
what
we
think
of
as
'reality'
is
still
a
dream.
And,
that
within
that
dream,
we
see
what
we
want
to
see
-
projection
makes
perception.
Thus,
the
movie
is
devised
so
that
some
viewers
look
at
the
spinning
top
and
see
it
as
being
about
to
fall
over
as
the
movie
ends.
They
decide
that
the
movie
is
saying
that
Cobb
is
back
in
'reality'
and
not
dreaming.
Others
see
the
top
as
going
to
continue
spinning
indefinitely.
But,
one
then
inevitably
asks,
how
could
Cobb
be
still
in
a
dream?
Which
leads
us
to
think
hard,
to
debate,
to
share
ideas,
and
perhaps
eventually
to
question
the
unquestionable
-
that
'reality'
is
not
what
it
seems
to
be.
Nolan
is
cleverly
sowing
a
key
idea
in
our
consciousness.
So
you
could
say
the
movie
Inception
is
in
itself...
an
inception!
Within
this
interpretative
framework,
Nolan
is
reaching
to
us
within
the
'dream'
that
we
call
reality
to
help
us
to
start
to
challenge
our
assumptions
about
'reality'
and
begin
to
wake
up
-
just
as
Cobb
went
into
limbo
to
get
Saito.<br
/><br
/>Yet
for
an
inception
to
work,
one
must
accept
it
as
one's
own
thought
process...
so
of
course
Nolan
does
not
give
interviews
where
he
says,
'This
is
a
movie
where
I'm
trying
to
wake
people
up
to
the
fact
that
they're
dreaming'.

<p

In
Greek
Mythology
she
was
considered
the
&quot;Mistress
of
the
Labyrinth.&quot;
In
the
legend
of
Theseus
and
the
Minotaur,
Ariadne
()
was
a
princess
of
Crete
and
her
father
(the
king)
created
a
labyrinth
with
a
minotaur
inside
it.
Every
year
seven
men
and
seven
women
would
have
to
be
sacrificed
to
it.
One
year
a
hero
named
Theseus
offered
to
kill
the
minotaur
and
Ariadne
fell
in
love
with
him
so
she
gave
him
a
ball
of
string
before
he
entered
the
labyrinth
as
well
as
directions.
Theseus
was
able
to
kill
the
minotaur
and
took
Ariadne
for
his
bride.
In
some
accounts
of
the
myth,
Theseus
later
abandoned
Ariadne
on
the
island
of
Naxos,
where
she
was
discovered
and
rescued
by
the
god
Dionysus.
Ariadne
eventually
became
the
wife
of
Dionysus
and
joined
the
pantheon
of
gods
on
Mount
Olympus.
This
song
can
also
be
read
as
backing
the
theory
that
'Inception'
follows
the
metaphysics
of
A
Course
in
Miracles,
a
spiritual
text
which
describes
humanity
as
dreaming.
The
dream
is
described
in
the
Course
as
having
a
flavour
or
underlying,
all-pervasive
guilt
-
just
as
Cobb
tells
Adriadne
he
experiences.
Truth,
says
ACIM,
is
buried
deep
in
the
dreamer's
unconscious
mind
(cf
Mal's
safe),
and
Spirit
tries
to
wake
us
up
to
our
innocence
through
what
is
metaphorically
described
as
'an
ancient
melody'
that
speaks
of
our
innocence
-
(cf
'Je
ne
regrette
rien'
as
the
call
to
wake
up
throughout
the
movie).
Cobb
is
told
by
Ariadne
that
the
key
to
him
undoing
the
nightmarish
situation
in
which
he
is
entrapped
with
Mal
is
forgiveness.
And
so
'Mal'
('bad
/
evil'
in
French
and
Spanish)
is
undone
by
Forgiveness.
Cobb
forgives
both
Mal
and
himself,
releases
his
regrets,
and
so
heals
his
past
(another
key
theme
of
ACIM).
Thus
in
the
movie,
Ariadne
serves
as
the
'mistress
of
the
labyrinth'
both
in
the
obvious
sense
of
devising
dream
labyrinthine
architecture,
and
in
the
more
subtle
sense
of
leading
Cobb
out
of
his
mental
imprisonment.

It

The

enter

connects
to
the

of
the

it

not
appear
to

The

There
are
2
main
theories:
(1)
Limbo:
When
Fischer
and
Saito
died
in
Eames'
dream
(the
snow
fortress),
they
both
went
to
limbo.
If
the
decaying
city
was
Cobb's
dream,
Fischer
would
not
have
been
there.
Therefore
both
the
decaying
city
and
Saito's
palace
had
to
have
been
limbo.
Limbo
looks
like
it's
Cobb's
dream
because
it
was
made
by
Cobb
and
Mal
when
they
were
in
limbo.
Otherwise
limbo
is
an
empty
dream
space.
(2)
Cobb's
Dream:
When
Fischer
died
in
Eames'
dream,
Ariadne
proposes
that
there
is
a
different
way.
She
and
Cobb
go
into
yet
another
level
of
dream.
When
she
finds
Fischer
and
hears
the
signal
in
this
dream,
she
throws
him
off
the
ledge.
This
is
synched
up
with
Eames
using
the
defibrillator,
reviving
Fischer
and
allowing
him
to
complete
his
realization
of
the
inception.
The
problem
with
this
second
theory
is
that
why
and
how
Fisher
would
be
in
that
dream
with
Cobb
and
Ariadne?
He
wasn't
even
hooked
to
the
dream
machine
to
share
it.
Plus,
the
conversation
there
between
Cobb,
Ariadne
and
Mal
as
well
as
Cobb's
willingness
&quot;to
stay
behind&quot;
to
find
Saito,
suggest
that
they
are,
in
fact,
in
Limbo.

<p

Due
to
the
sedative,
a
synchronized
multi-level
kick
was
needed
(the
van
freefalling,
the
original
plan
for
the
hotel
floor
explosion,
and
the
snow
fortress
explosion.)
Yusuf's
kick
(van
freefall)
was
too
early
due
to
Fischer's
projections
attacking,
and
thus,
the
kicks
weren't
synchronized.
This
was
designed
to
ensure
that
the
team
was
able
to
stay
where
they
needed
to
and
finish
the
job.
If
one
kick
failed
because
it
wasn't
synchronized,
they
could
try
another
while
using
the
musical
countdown
to
warn
the
next
level
that
it
was
coming.
Earlier
in
the
movie
Arthur
tells
Ariadne
that
if
Yusuf
kicks
too
early
(ie,
if
he
drives
the
van
off
the
bridge
before
Arthur
has
a
chance
to
kick
the
group
out
of
Eames'
dream),
they
won't
wake
up.
While
normally
in
order
to
wake
up
you
must
receive
a
kick
in
the
level
above,
this
isn't
true
when
using
the
special
sedative.
Instead
with
the
sedative
it
takes
two
or
more
synchronized
kicks
in
all
levels
simultaneously.
Arthur
didn't
have
the
second
kick
ready
when
the
van
drove
off
the
bridge,
so
he
wasn't
awakened
by
the
van
falling
off
the
bridge.
When
the
elevator
hit
the
ground
floor
and
the
group
was
kicked
by
the
freefall,
they
were
pulled
out
of
Eames'
dream
(the
snow
fortress)
and
simultaneously
pulled
back
into
Yusuf's
dream
(the
van).
Cobb
and
Saito
weren't
kicked
back
up
because
they
were
still
stuck
in
limbo
and
weren't
being
kicked
at
that
moment.
So
they
were
left
in
the
van
underwater
still
attached
to
the
dreaming
device.

The
inception
mission
is
planned
to
be
about
10
hours
in
reality.
So,
the
sedative
was
supposed
to
last
&quot;about
10
hours&quot;.
The
flight
they
were
on
(Sydney
to
L.A.)
takes
10
hours
according
to
Saito.
The
plane
was
getting
ready
to
land
when
Cobb
and
Saito
woke
up.
The
stewardess
was
passing
out
immigration
forms
and
telling
the
passengers
to
get
ready
for
descent
in
twenty
minutes'
time.
Presumably,
the
time
taken
to
drug
Fischer
(after
seat
belt
sign
is
off,
so
30
-
45
min),
time
needed
for
the
drug
to
fully
take
effect
(about
1
hr),
and
time
needed
to
perform
preparation
work
before
the
mission
(10
min).
Cobb
drugged
Fischer
so
they
could
connect
him
to
the
machine.
The
mission
starts
fairly
soon
after
the
plane
takes
off,
as
soon
as
the
seatbelt
signs
are
switched
off.
Let's
not
forget,
Saito
owns
the
airline
so
normal
procedures
may
not
have
been
followed.
Due
to
unforeseen
circumstances
(Saito
is
injured
and
dying
and
Fischer's
subconscious
having
been
trained
by
an
Extractor
before),
the
team
needed
to
complete
the
mission
as
fast
as
possible.
The
Inception
was
successful.
After
all
the
Kicks
are
synchronized,
everyone
other
than
Saito
and
Cobb
woke
up
on
the
first
level
of
the
dream.<br
/><br
/>Evidence:
Yusuf
is
seen
escaping
from
the
van
in
the
water,
but
he's
not
seen
after
that.
Only
Fischer,
Eames,
Ariadne
and
Arthur
are
shown
on
the
surface.
This
is
why
we
saw
Ariadne,
Arthur,
Eames
and
Fischer
all
awake
in
the
plane
when
Cobb
wakes
up.
Since
Yusuf
woke
up
instead
of
being
killed
like
Arthur
in
the
Extraction
mission,
the
dream
doesn't
collapse
and
looks
fine.
Even
if
the
dream
will
collapse
due
to
the
absence
of
the
Dreamer,
the
dream
could
still
be
momentarily
stable
due
to
the
fact
that
heavy
sedative
is
being
used.
In
addition,
it
probably
takes
30
-
40
seconds
for
Yusuf
to
wake
up
(due
to
heavy
sedation),
which
gives
10
-
14
minutes
in
a
level
1
dream.
This
leaves
Saito
and
Cobb
connected
with
the
machine.
The
timer
on
the
machine
is
still
in
countdown.
The
team
could
probably
hide
the
machine
from
Fischer
and
wait
for
the
timer
to
reach
zero
to
unhook
them
from
the
machine
(when
timer
is
zero,
it's
either
they
wake
up
or
in
a
coma)
or
it
could
be
the
drug
that
Cobb
gave
to
Fischer
is
a
strong
sedative
that
made
him
fall
in
deep
sleep
for
a
full
10
hours
and
woke
up
a
few
minutes
after
the
timer
on
the
machine
reaches
zero
but
before
Cobb
wakes
up.
(the
dream
machine
is
absent
when
Cobb
wakes
up
and
his
hand
is
not
hooked
to
a
wire.)
When
Saito
is
made
aware
that
he
and
Cobb
are
in
limbo,
they
shoot
themselves,
return
to
reality
just
in
time
as
the
timer
reaches
zero
and
the
team
unhooks
them
from
the
machine.
However,
Cobb
and
Saito
didn't
wake
up
immediately
since
it
may
take
some
time
for
the
strong
sedative
to
wear
off
(a
few
minutes
later).

Yes.

No.
The
room
behind
her
is
fine.
The
room
she
lured
Cobb
to
is
trashed
because
she
is
setting
up
a
crime
scene
that
will
implicate
Cobb
in
her
death.
She
lures
Cobb
to
the
room
across
from
her
so
she
can
try
to
convince
him
to
die
with
her,
without
giving
him
any
chance
of
stopping
her.
Here
she
shows
a
more
sinister
side:
if
he
doesn't
join
her
in
jumping
off
the
ledge
willingly
out
of
love
for
her,
she
has
made
it
so
he
might
be
pressured
to
jump
unwillingly
to
avoid
being
framed
for
her
murder.
And,
in
fact,
it
is
because
he
doesn't
jump
that
he
ends
up
framed
for
her
murder,
which
would
motivate
Cobb
to
follow
after
Mal
and
commit
suicide
to
avoid
a
life
sentence.
So
she
was
hedging
her
bets,
so
in
every
scenario
he
would
wind
up
dying
to
join
her
in
what
she
believed
would
be
the
real
world.

Time

1,

planted:
I

Method:
Eames
disguises

Browning,
Fischer's
godfather
and
convinces
him
that
his

loves
him
and
doesn't

self-generated)
has
an
alternate

Method:
By

the

The

Mal.

that

The
evidence
is
generally
very
weak
in
demonstrating
that
the
&quot;reality&quot;
present
in
the
film
is
any
different
than
the
reality
that
we
experience
every
day.<br
/><br

Repeated
lines
of
dialog
shared
amongst
the

Mal
and
Saito
both
tell
Cobb
to
take
a
&quot;leap
of
faith&quot;,
and
Cobb
predicts
what
Saito
will
say
in

[However,
coincidental
and
repeated
lines
are
common
in
countless
films
without
any
reason
to
believe
they
are
&quot;all
a
dream.&quot;
Additionally,
the
term
&quot;take
a
leap
of
faith&quot;
would
be
basically
ubiquitous
in
a
world
where
one
must
actually
kill
themselves
just
to
wake
up
from
a
dream.]<br
/><br
/>4.
The
clumsiness
of
the
homicide
police
investigation
regarding
Mal's
case
and
put
the
blame
on
Cobb
entirely.
[we
don't
know
all
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
investigation,
and
bad
investigations
happen
all
the
time,
so
this
is
hardly
evidence
for
the
whole
film
being
a
dream]<br
/><br
/>5.
The
spinning
top
at
the
end
of
the
film.
The
top
is
a
totem
used
to
help
verify
whether
Cobb's
in
reality
or
in
someone
else's
dream,
but
it
offers
no
verification
against
being
in
his
own
dream.
He
knows
the
exact
weight,
composition
and
how
it
should
spin.
So
whether
the
top
stops
or
continue
spinning,
it's
not
important
as
even
when
it
stops,
it
could
be
that
Cobb
believes
that
he
finally
reunite
with
his
family,
hence
his
dream
fully
becomes
his
reality.
[it's
true
that
if
the
whole
film
is
a
dream,
the
top
wouldn't
matter,
but
this
is
not
evidence
for
the
film
being
a
dream.
You
could
say
that
about
any
behavior
of
any
object
in
the
whole
movie]<br
/><br
/>6.
In
Mombasa,
in
the
bathroom
after
he
tests
Yusuf's
sedative,
you
see
the
figure
of
Mal
behind
the
curtains,
if
he
was
in
&quot;reality&quot;
then
his
subconscious
could
not
be
projecting
her.
[Not
projections.
These
were
just
memories.
The
curtains
were
not
in
Yusuf's
bathroom
-
they
are
the
same
curtains
as
in
the
hotel
room.]<br
/><br
/>7.
Cobb's
totem
was
not
Mal's
top,
rather
one
could
suggest
that
Mal
was
his
reality
check,
his
'real'
totem.
Yet
throughout
the
movie
he
was
directly
or
indirectly
responsible
for
either
killing
her
or
imprisoning
her,
in
essence
losing
his
sense
of
reality
and
refusing
to
face
up
to
the
facts
-
which
may
be
that
he
was
indeed
dreaming
the
whole
time.
[Cobb's
totem
was
Mal's
top.
In
no
way
was
Mal
his
reality
check
-
it
is
quite
the
opposite.]<br
/><br
/>8.
The
musical
score
that
is
heard,
is
the
slowed
down
playhead
of
&quot;Non,
Je
Ne
Regrette
Rien&quot;,
which
is
the
Edith
Piaf
song
used
for
the
musical
countdown.
The
significance
here
is
that
the
deeper
you
go
into
the
dream,
time
slows,
thus
the
music
will
slow
too,
mimicking
the
score.
This
musical
design
perhaps
indicates
that
Cobb's
reality
was
still
very
much
a
dream
state
too.
[the
music
only
slows
down
when
listened
to
from
a
lower
level,
due
to
the
time
dilation
at
that
level.
Yes,
the
song
was
integrated
into
the
score,
but
only
as
a
theme.]
[how
do
you
know?
maybe
the
original
poster
is
right)<br
/><br
/>9.
Numerous
improbable
or
coincidental
events
that
happened
during
parts
of
&quot;reality&quot;.
Cobb
is
saved
by
Saito
coincidentally
during
the
chase
between
Cobol
Engineering
agents
and
him.
[Saito
has
been
tailing
Cobb
to
protect
his
investment
-
not
coincidental
at
all.]<br
/><br
/>10.
Nearly
the
entire
team
is
highly
proficient
with
all
types
of
weaponry,
though
certainly
Cobb
at
least,
does
not
appear
to
have
had
any
particularized
weapons
training.
How
does
Ariadne
know
how
to
even
fire
a
gun,
much
less
hit
anything?
All
appear
to
be
highly
capable
in
all
sorts
of
militaristic
tasks,
from
skiing,
to
explosives,
to
hand
to
hand
combat,
to
sniping...
[They
are
in
a
dream
world
during
all
scenes
involving
weapon
use.
Their
real
world
weapon
abilities
would
have
no
effect
here.
Like
Eames

saying
on
level
1
'You
need

and
then
produces

grenade
launcher.
During
the
dream
state,
they
have
limited
control
over
the
experience,
similar
to
the
Matrix.]<br
/><br
/>11.
This
may
be
a
continuity
error,
but
when
Arthur
collegoes
to
get
Cobb
in
Tokyo
after
the
failed
extraction
of
Saito,
they
leave
the
hotel
room
and
go
to
the
roof

at
night.

list).<br

starts

movie
ends,
and
also
is
heard
to
topple
and
scoot
across
the
table
after
it
cuts
to
black.<br
/><br
/>Alternatively,'
the
whole
film
is
a
dream'
in
the
sense
that
Nolan
is
suggesting
that
what
we
think
of
as
a
waking
state,
or
'reality',
is
in
fact
just
more
dreaming
(which
is
not
supported
by
any
interviews
with
Nolan
or
statements
by
the
cast/crew
anywhere).<br
/><br
/>Hinduism
and
Buddhism
both
share
the
idea
that
the
world
is
'maya',
or
an
illusion
and
that
we
are
on
a
journey
of
'awakening
from
the
dream'.
This
has
been
taught
by
such
Indian
saints
as
Sri
Ramana
Maharishi
and
Maharishi
Mahesh
Yogi,
who
call
it
'Advaida',
which
means
non-duality;
the
idea
that
all
the
universe
is
just
one
consciousness,
connecting
everything
in
it.
We
act
out
our
lives
like
a
play
shown
onto
a
movie
screen.
But
only
those
who
achieve
Nirvana
(a.k.a
enlightenment,
or
becoming
one
with
Nature)
can
perceive
the
illusion
for
what
it
is
(a
dream)
and
become
aware
of
the
'screen'
on
which
the
great
drama
is
unfolding.<br
/><br
/>According
to
the
Advaida
philosophy,
it
is
only
when
we
are
in
a
state
of
deep
sleep
that
we
come
close
to
the
timeless,
'true'
state
of
being
that
is
the
universal
consciousness,
which
all
Nature
is
part
of.
When
we
wake
up,
in
effect
we
are
waking
into
a
world
that
is
illusory.<br
/><br
/>A
separate
movement
believes
in
the
specific
idea
that
humanity
is
collectively
dreaming
a
dream
of
guilt
and
separation,
from
which
we
need
to
wake
up
by
practising
forgiveness.
This
is
a
metaphysic
ideology
given
in
A
Course
in
Miracles
and
The
Way
of
Mastery,
which
are
spiritual
texts
purportedly
channelled
from
Jesus
in
the
1970s
and
1990s
respectively.
ACIM
in
particular
has
influenced
most
spiritual
'new
age'
authors
and
commentators
today.

1.
The
wedding
ring
on
Cobb's
hand
that's
present
in
dreams
but
absent
in
the
real
world.<br
/><br
/>[To
refute:
This
could
be
because
in
what
Cobb
sees
as
a
dream,
he
wants
Mal
to
still
be
alive
and
married
to
him
(keeps
her
alive
in
his
memories),
but
in
so-called
reality,
Cobb
knows
he's
not
married
anymore
and
took
it
off.
It
may,
in
fact,
be
his
totem,
so
if
Cobb
took
it
off
long
ago
he
would
*not*
know
that
he
wasn't
in
reality.
While
mourning
his
wife
I
doubt
he
would
consciously
check
the
weight.
If
&quot;reality&quot;
is
*his*
dream,
which
Mal
says
in
an
argument
while
alive,
his
subconscious
would
recreate
the
weight
anyway;
totems
only
tell
you
when
you're
in
someone
else's
head
unless
you
know
you're
dreaming.]<br
/><br
/>2.
Cobb's
kids,
Phillipa
&amp;
James.
The
kids
at
the
end
of
the
film
are
different
and
are
older
compared
to
the
younger
ones
we've
seen
throughout
the
film.
Their
clothes
are
slightly
different.
The
girl
has
a
white
shirt
underneath
her
red
dress
and
his
son
was
wearing
shoes
instead
of
sandals
at
the
end.
This
is
the
most
solid
evidence.
Observe
carefully.
Also
if
he
was
dreaming,
he
would
not
be
able
to
know
what
his
children's
faces
would
have
looked
like
turning
around
and
seeing
him
seeing
as
how
he
cannot
change
a
memory.
He
even
said
himself
earlier
in
the
film
that
no
matter
how
hard
he
tried,
he,
&quot;can't
change
this
moment.&quot;
He
will
never
see
his
children's
faces
unless
he
gets
back
to
them.
[He
couldn't
change
the
moment
because
of
the
guilt
(which
he
has
now
freed
at
the
end
of
the
movie),
but
yes,
the
clothes
and
actors
were
different.
This
is
solid
evidence.]
[But
he
did
change
his
memory
when
he
saw
him
and
Mal
young
at
the
time
of
their
deaths
in
Limbo,
so
why
couldnt
he
change
this
memory?
and
if
they
were
invisioned
young
becasue
it
was
from
Ariadne's
point
of
view
(as
explained
form
one
of
the
otehr
FAQ
questions)
and
she
only
knew
them
as
young,
then
why
could
she
invision
them
as
old
at
the
end
of
the
film,
when
she
didnt
know
what
they
looked
like
old?
Couldnt
Cobb
invision
his
children
as
older,
knowing
that
they
were
older?]<br
/><br
/>3.
The
top.
There's
a
significant
difference
between
the
top
that
keeps
spinning
flawlessly
when
he's
in
a
dream
and
the
top
that's
spinning
at
the
end
of
the
film
(it
clearly
wobbles,
loses
momentum
and
does
sound
like
it
is
stopping.)
[It
does
wobble
and
lose
momentum,
strong
signs,
but
to
me
it
sounded
not
like
it
toppled
but
that
the
sound
for
the
top
cut
out.
I
re-watched
the
movie
yesterday.]
But
Totems
tell
you
when
you
are
not
in
your
own
dream,
so
maybe
it
stopped
spinning
because
it
is
his
dream
(?)
(No,
It
only
tells
you
that
you
are
dreaming,
it
has
no
specificity
to
who's
dream
it
is.)<br
/><br
/>4.
It
is
showed
at
the
end
that
Cobb
and
Mal
did
grow
old
together
for
50
years
in
Limbo
with
them
walking
the
streets
as
old
man
and
woman,
two
old
hands
hold
together
on
the
train
tracks.<br
/><br
/>5.
The
rules,
technical
aspects
of
performing
the
Extraction
and
Inception
in
the
film.<br
/><br
/>6.
Cobb
remembers
exactly
how
he
got
to
where
he
is,
which
he
wouldn't
know
if
he
was
dreaming.
[Oh?
Where
was
the
car
ride
from
the
airport
to
home?
Did
he
even
think
to
try
to
remember?
Not
that
I
believe
that
he
was
dreaming,
but
it
isn't
explicitly
stated.]<br
/><br
/>7.
The
emotional
depth
of
the
film.
If
the
ending
is
real,
it
shows
that
Cobb
does
go
on
an
emotional
journey,
to
take
a
'leap
of
faith'
to
believe
that
Saito
will
honor
their
agreement
so
he
could
go
home
and
see
his
kids
and
finally
get
over
with
his
wife's
death
and
guilt.
The
scene
where
Cobb
talks
with
old
Saito
is
significant
as
it
shows
they've
grown
and
become
friends,
as
Cobb
had
said
to
him:
&quot;Come
back
and
let's
be
young
men
together.&quot;
He's
'transformed'
because
of
his
leap
of
faith
and
he's
rewarded
by
finally
reuniting
with
his
kids.
[This
is
hardly
evidence
to
support
it
was
reality,
even
if
I
agree
that
it
was.
The
important
part
to
the
ending
is
that
it
doesn't
actually
matter
if
the
top
fell
or
not-
if
it's
reality
or
not.
The
character
arc
you
are
talking
about
could
have
happened
with
or
without
reality
and
in
the
end
Cobb
gets
what
he
wants/needs.
That
is
the
resolution.]<br
/><br
/>8.
Cobb
and
Mal
do
not
end
up
together.
This
could
only
be
a
factor
of
reality.
If
it
were
a
dream,
Cobb
would
have
found
a
way
of
keeping
Mal
alive
in
the
dream
so
that
he
could
be
with
her.
[*Very*
solid
evidence.]
(Cobb
wouldn't
want
to
do
this
because
he
states
that
his
recreation
of
her
in
his
dreams
&quot;isn't
good
enough&quot;
because
it
doesn't
truly
capture
what
she
was
in
real
life,
with
all
her
perfection
and
flaws.)<br
/><br
/>9.
Throughout
the
shooting
script
Nolan
uses
the
simple
transitional
element
for
changing
scenes,
&quot;and
we--
CUT
TO:&quot;
every
time
this
occurs
it's
not
cutting
to
another
scene
with
in
the
'present'
reality,
but
it
'cuts
to'
either
a
higher
or
lower
dream
within
the
dream,
or
it
'cuts
to'
reality.
So
at
the
end
of
the
shooting
script
Nolan
writes
&quot;And
we--
FADE
OUT.&quot;
By
Nolan
saying
that
it
doesn't
'cut
to'
another
level
of
the
dream,
or
back
to
reality,
but
instead
it
simply
'fades
out,'
Nolan
is
letting
us,
the
viewer,
know
that
after
reality
there
is
nothing
to
'cut
to,'
so
Cobb
is
presently
in
reality.
Nolan
allows
the
viewer
to
make
his/her
own
assumptions
based
upon
their
optimistic/pessimistic
worldview,
but
Nolan's
in
one
of
optimism,
as
can
be
seen
in
all
his
other
films.
He's
not
a
'happy
ending'
director,
but
he's
optimistic
about
the
future...
[All
scripts
start
with
Fade
In
and
end
with
Fade
Out...]<br
/><br
/>10.
A
second
after
'INCEPTION'
appears
on
the
end
credits,
you
can
begin
hearing
the
top
lose
momentum
in
its
spin
(it
sounds
almost
like
it's
sliding
along
the
table).
Now
that
the
film
is
out
on
Blu-ray
and
DVD,
I
imagine
that
more
people
will
notice
this.
Keep
in
mind,
there
is
music
playing
during
the
credits
so
you
do
have
to
listen
for
it,
but
it
the
sound
is
there.
I'm
100%
sure.
I
kept
an
ear
out
for
this
after
Dileep
Rao
said
to
&quot;use
your
ears,
not
your
eyes&quot;
to
figure
out
if
the
top
fell
or
not.
Well,
using
your
ears,
you
will
hear
it
losing
momentum
until
it
comes
to
a
stop.
If
anybody
has
any
other
interpretation
as
to
what
this
means,
I'm
interested
in
hearing
it.
[See
annotation
for
number
3.]<br
/><br
/>Alternatively,
Nolan
is
showing
that
what
we
commonly
believe
to
be
reality
exists
during
the
film,
and
that
Cobb
is
indeed
in
what
we'd
call
'reality'
at
the
end
of
the
film.
BUT,
the
spinning
top
is
a
clue
from
him
-
an
inception
to
us,
the
audience
-
that
our
idea
of
'reality'
may
in
itself
be
the
projection
of
a
dreaming
mind....
that
collectively,
we
are
all
dreaming
an
outpictured
'reality'
full
of
projected
figures.
For
more
on
this
idea
and
its
spiritual
origins
and
reasoning,

the
previous
FAQ
(and
others).

The
evidence
strongly
suggests
that
he
did.
Multiple
cast
members
who
worked
with
Christopher
Nolan
directly
and
heard
his
whole
vision
of
the
movie
probably
ad
nauseum,
including
Michael
Caine
explicitly,
and
Dileep
Rao
implicitly,
confirm
that
the
ending
is
part
of
reality.
The
top
is
heard
strongly
wobbling,
about
to
tip
as
the
screen
cuts
to
black.
Upon
the
completion
of
a
successful
mission
with
the
team,
one
could
either
believe
that
Cobb
was
able
to
save
Saito
and
himself
from
Limbo,
reuniting
him
with
his
family
in
reality,
or
we
can
believe
that
he
was
stuck
forever
and
ever
more
in
his
Limbo
and
had
only
imagined
him
saving
Saito
and
reuniting
with
his
family.
The
latter
theory,
however,
does
not
match
with
any
characteristics
of
Limbo
presented
in
the
movie.
In
order
for
the
final
scenes
with
Cobb
to
be
Limbo,
he
(who
knows
that
Limbo
is
not
real)
would
have
to
build
an
airplane,
recreate
all
his
team
members,
create
and
populate
the
entire
city
of
Los
Angeles,
and
then
create
his
children
two
years
older.
And
also
create
a
Limbo
where
tops
wobble
instead
of
spinning
perfectly.
Then,
he
would
have
to
forget
it
was
Limbo
and
&quot;wake
up&quot;
on
the
plane
he

years
apart).
There
are
multiple
memories,
some
of
which
show
the
younger
children
playing
at
the
beach,
others
show
the
younger
children
playing
in
the
yard
throughout
the
film.
The
younger
children
also
appear
run
around
a
corner
leading
Cobb
to
Mal
in
the
final
limbo.
Certainly
the
children
appear
to
be
a
similar
age,
and
to
be
wearing
similar
clothing.
Repeat
analysis
shows
that
the
clothing
is
similar
at
the
end,
though
not
the
same.
The
children
do
look
older.
However,
considering
the
power
of
the
dreamer
to
alter
the
world
of
the
dream,
this
is
no
guarantee
that
the
children,
if
indeed
they
are
projections,
haven't
just
been
changed
by
Cobb
so
that
he
will
accept
them
as
real.
Certainly
the
story
is
very
clever
in
creating
this
ambiguity.
Cobb
is
unable
to
see
their
faces
in
his
memory
of
the
yard
to
confirm
they
look
younger
(the
body
shows
they
are
smaller).
Other
theories
have
suggested
that
the
reason
for
casting
two
sets
of
child
actors
were
to
have
one
set
visible,
while
the
other
set
only
heard.
The
voices
of
the
children
on
the
phone
seem
older
than
what
would
belong
to
the
children
playing.

Nolan
acknowledges
that
it's
not
easy
to
follow:
Right
before
the
dreamers
head
down
to
Level
3,
an
exasperated
Ariadne
asks,
&quot;Wait
--
whose
subconscious
are
we
going
into?&quot;
But
once
you
know
what
to
look,
or
more
importantly,
to
listen
for,
the
clues
are
all
there.
The
opening
sequence
is
Arthur's
dream
(the
villa)
inside
Nash's
dream
(the
apartment).
The
training
exercises
follow
a
similar
pattern:
first
the
teacher
(Cobb
in
the
cafe;
Arthur
on
the
Penrose
staircase),
then
Ariadne
in
her
own
version
of
the
same
environment.
The
main
mission
is
Eames'
dream
(the
snow
fort)
inside
Arthur's
dream
(the
hotel)
inside
Yusuf's
dream
(the
city).
Limbo
is
apparently
limbo;
it
doesn't
belong
to
anyone,
although
Cobb
can
claim
squatters'
rights.
One
relatively
easy
way
of
keeping
it
straight
is
that
the
person
whose
dream
it
is
stays
behind
in
order
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
place.
Yusuf
drives
the
van;
Arthur
fights
the
guard
in
the
hotel;
Eames
sets
the
explosive
charges.
Is
this
simply
a
matter
of
convenience,
or
are
dreams
limited
to
one
apiece?
Can
you
fall
asleep
in
your
own
dream?
It
would
seem
so,
because
Cobb
and
Mal
went
down
several
levels,
presumably
on
their
own.

now
dies

The

Possibility
#1:
Although
some
may
believe
that
the
air
hostess
simply
knocking
each
passenger
off
their
seat
would
wake
them,
others
suggest
it's
more
likely
that
the
pilots
dipped
the
plane
momentarily.
(Given
Saito
owned
the
airline)
It
is
unlikely
however
that
the
air
hostess
or
pilots
could
have
been
prepared
to
apply
a
kick
as
A-
They
didn't
provide
a
musical
countdown
B-
Eames
suggests
that
the
original
time
scale
of
the
plan
was
a
lot
slower,
with
him
having
the
whole
night
to
crack
Fischer.
Since
they
didn't
know
in
advance
that
Fischer's
mind
would
be
militarised,
why
would
they
have
needed
to
plan
a
kick?<br
/><br
/>Possibility
#2:
Yusuf
had
designed
the
sedatives
to
wear
off
after
a
specific
amount
of
time
and
they
simply
killed
themselves
to
wake
up:
This
doesn't
really
make
sense
because
the
sedative
would
have
to
be
in
effect
for
the
whole
dream;
otherwise
Cobb
couldn't
have
confidently
stated
they
had
a
week
of
dream
time.
It
is
possible
however
that
Yusuf
had
an
antidote
he
had
given
to
the
air
hostess
to
administer
at
a
specific
time.<br
/><br
/>Possibility
#3:
They
waited
around
for
another
6
days
till
they
simply
awoke
from
the
dream.
This
is
highly
unlikely
given
how
militarised
Fischer's
subconscious
was!
This
is
the
most
likely
possibility,
but
is
a
little
far
fetched
considering
how
Satio
didn't
even
survive
a
few
hours
in
that
militarised
environment
without
getting
shot.<br
/><br
/>Possibility
#3B:
They
waited
around
another
6
days
till
they
awoke
from
the
dream.
Sure,
Fischer's
subconscious
was
militarized,
HOWEVER,
they
don't
attack
until
Fischer
gets
kidnapped.
So
one
could
assume
that
once
the
van
hits
the
water,
the
others
wait
underneath
in
order
to
avoid
being
seen
by
Fischer,
so
Fischer
assumes
he
is
now
safe,
and
in
the
real
world.
So
his
subconscious
would
then
back
off
and
be
easier
to
evade.<br
/><br
/>Possibility
#4:
Since
the
ending
of
the
film
is
ambiguous;
the
whole
ending
with
them
waking
up
on
the
plane
might
not
be
reality.
And
therefore
is
not
proof
that
the
rest
of
the
crew
made
it
out
of
the
first
level
of
the
dream.
If
we
are
never
shown
Eames,
Yusuf,
Ariadne
and
Fischer
waking
on
the
plane
in
reality,
then
for
all
we
know,
they're
still
hanging
out
in
level
one.<br
/><br
/>IMPOSSIBILITY:
Some
suggest
that
because
Yusuf
isn't
shown
on
camera
after
the
van
plunges
into
the
water;
it's
possible
he
was
kicked
out
of
the
dream
and
was
awoken
because
he
was
conscious
when
the
rest
in
the
van
weren't,
he
then
turned
off
the
dream
machine/woke
them
up
in
reality.
This
isn't
possible
for
several
reasons;
firstly
because,
as
we
see
with
Arthur
when
the
van
drives
off
the
edge;
he
didn't
get
kicked
out
of
the
dream!
We
assume
this
is
because
they
all
have
to
come
out
of
the
dream
at
once.
Secondly,
the
city
where
the
van
falls
off
the
bridge
is
in
Yusuf's
mind,
so
if
he
woke
up,
surely
everyone
would
be
thrust
into
limbo?

they're
EXPERIENCING

lack
of
gravity.
It's
the
movement

affects
the

not
the
experience

thus,
because
the

probably
can't

The

The

itself
does
not

to

-
it
could
exist
as
an
idea
or
projection
in
the
dream.
For

the

probably
do
not
understand
the

of
their
weapons
but
they
have
an
innate
understanding
and
conviction
of

(bullet

With
training

a

could

That
may
seem
to
be
what
Cobb,
Saito
and
the
rest
of
the
team
want
Fischer
to
believe,
but
it
seems
as
though
the
sequencing
of
the
mission
with
what
specifically
revolves
around
the
aspects
that
Fischer
experiences
supports
it
too.
With
Cobb
and
his
team
having
exposed
deception
that
Browning
had
employed
at
one
point,
this
leads
them
to
follow
the
possibility
that
Fischer's
father
wanted
what
was
best
for
his
son
and
therefore,
allow
him
to
trust
his
own
judgment
when
it
came
to
anything
involving
such.
Thus,
Browning
attempted
to
have
Fischer
continue
running
the
company
the
way
his
father
did
so
it
would
benefit
him,
while
Fischer's
father
who
had
not
realized
how
much
he
had
neglected
his
son
until
the
end
of
his
life
had
actually
desired
better
for
him.
Fischer
himself
believes
in
the
idea
of
doing
right
in
his
own
life
per
his
father's
wishes
by
deciding
to
break
up
the
company,
which
is
not
only
what
Cobb,
Saito
and
the
team
sought
to
happen
in
the
end,
but
rather
what
Fischer
was
destined
to
do
to
begin
with.
Therefore,
the
mission
actually
doesn't
just
benefit
Saito's
own
ambitions,
but
corrects
a
karmic
injustice
too.
